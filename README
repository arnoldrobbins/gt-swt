============================

These tapes were read for us by Sydex.  The documentation they include
with the resulting tape images includes the note:

    The original SIMH document specifies only that blocks containing
    media errors be flagged with bit 31 of the record length set
    (80000000 hex). Nothing is said about how to differentiate those
    media errors that return data and those that donâ€™t. For the latter
    type of error, we use a record length count of 4, which is
    impossible with most tape formatters, as it will be treated as noise
    and ignored. The actual content of the 4 byte record is undefined.

It turns out that some .tap-reading software does not correctly consume
this type of error block.  The swt91_tape.tap file has had the 4-byte
error block replaced with a 0-byte block, making it more palatable to
such software.  Specifically, offsets 477888-477899 were replaced with
the bytes (little-endian, hex) 00 00 00 80: a simple 0-byte error block
indicator.
