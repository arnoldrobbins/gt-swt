Description:


when i test the COV condition in an IF statement, it does not
perform the following statement, even tho the simulator output
says the COV condition is set. in the sample program, the CTR is
loaded with 254, incremented twice, and then the COV is tested.
if COV is true, then LC1 should be set. another file in the same
directory called t3.d shows that the LC1 & 2 can actually be set
