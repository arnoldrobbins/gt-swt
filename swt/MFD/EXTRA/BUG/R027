Re: source

Description:


If the file containing the source code for a routine is actually an archive,
source prints out the whole archive.

It should be changed to look for a trailing .a on the file name, and if so,
extract the file first, and then print it.  This should be pretty trivial
to do, and it's pretty bad that it happened in the first place!
