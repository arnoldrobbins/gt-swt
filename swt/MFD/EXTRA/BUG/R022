Bug Number 022

Re: ph

Description:

If two ph commands are executed one immediately after the other (from
a shell file), and the second ph executes before the first phantom opens
the ph=pid= file, then the second ph will reuse that file and both phantoms
will execute the same commands, namely those from the second ph command.
I don't have any idea how to fix it, but it should at least be documented
in the Bugs section of the help entry.
