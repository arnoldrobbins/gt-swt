Re: ph

Description:

If two (or more) ph commands are executed one immediately after the other
(from a shell file, for example), and the second ph executes before the
first phantom has begun execution, then the second ph will reuse the
ph=pid= file created by the first ph, and both phantoms will execute the
commands of the second ph command.  I sure don't know how to fix it, but
it should at least be documented in the Bugs section of the ph entry.
