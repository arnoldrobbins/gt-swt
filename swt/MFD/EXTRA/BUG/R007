Re: guess

Description:

if a long series of letters (such as 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' is
entered as a command, guess will sit in an infinite loop. below a certain 
size (i believe about 30 or so characters) guess will work very quickly on
slightly shorter strings.
try using guess with about a 40-character string and see what it does.
