Re: moot

Description:

I was adding a member to a conference (Systems_Simulator) and it gave me
the message that "//bcs/moot_dir/users: can't open" when I gave it my user name.
Then it asked the status question, and I answered it and got the message
"//bcs/moot_dir/users:  can't open for update" and then was tossed out of moot
. Then I couldn't get back in except by editing the users file.
