lSometimes, when a new user is using software he or she is not
lcompletely familiar with, mistakes will occur. Such mistakes
lcan often result in the erroneous inclusion of many duplicate
lentries. Since the duplicate entries that you refer to were
lpart of a learning experience and they prompted a change in
lthe software, I would believe that they were useful. That is
lthe reason for the apparent duplication of entries in this
lconference.

lPardon my uninformed observations, but I have yet to read an
lentry in this conference that makes the least bit of sense!
lIf I didn't know better, I would claim that the entries
lheretofore submitted were nothing more than idle chatter
lproduced solely for the purpose of allowing the submitter
lto "hear himself talk."

lSince the inception of this conference, many people have added
ltext for the primary purpose of testing 'moot'. As it seems to
lhave generated some rather "light" reading material while
lfulfilling the purpose of testing 'moot', I can see no particular
lreason for the necessity of critiquing the other entries. Perhaps
lwhat we need is a conference named 'bull' in which most of this
ltesting can be accomplished.

lThe entry to which you refer was not intended to serve as
la reprimand for its refered entries; insetad it was simply
lan attempt to answer the question that was asked in the 
lpreviously referred-to entry. No appology was necessary.
