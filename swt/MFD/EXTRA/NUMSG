     Welcome to the Software Tools Subsystem.  

     This  subsystem  represents  an  attempt to provide you
with  a  rational,  human-engineered  environment  for   the
development  of software.  It insulates you from most of the
drawbacks of the Primos operating system and  permits  great
flexibility  in  such matters as input and output, parameter
passing, file system interfacing and the like.
     Most  of  the  programs  in  Kernighan  and   Plauger's
SOFTWARE TOOLS are now supported as they appear in the book.
     Detailed  information  on  individual  commands  may be
found in the Software Tools Subsystem Reference Manual which
is available in hard copy as well  as  on-line  through  the
'help'  command.   In addition, the Software Tools Subsystem
User's Guide provides a more tutorial introduction  to  some
of  the  major components of the Subsystem.  See your system
administrator for details on how to obtain printed copies of
Subsystem documentation.
     As  a  new user, your erase (character delete) and kill
(line delete) characters have been set to CTRL-H and  RUBOUT
(a.k.a.   DEL), respectively.  You may change these settings
as you wish; see the 'term' command for details.
     Have fun!
