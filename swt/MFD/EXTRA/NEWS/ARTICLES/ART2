                 Going =home= has new meaning
                 ----------------------------

 In  the  never  ending  changes  caused  by  new versions of
 PRIMOS, a new one that may affect most us has  been  instal-
 led.

 The  template  '=home='  is  now  a dynamic template and its
 value is based on the intial attach  point.   Also  '=ubin='
 has  been  redefined  to  reference  the  user  bins through
 =home=.  This means that the 'cd' command with no  arguments
 will  put  you in the same directory as PRIMOS does at login
 and ring 3 initialization.  The  effect  on  '=ubin='  means
 that  you  can  have  different  "ubin"s for different login
 projects.  If this capability is  not  desired,  you  should
 define  a  personnal  template for '=ubin=' as the directory
 where your personal commands are located.

 If you have any problems caused by  these  changes,  contact
