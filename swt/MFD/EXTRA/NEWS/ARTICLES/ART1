FOURTH GENERATION FROM ICC


Timely introduction of a true fourth-generation computer was
made last  week  by  ICC  (Inoperable Computer Corporation).
The unit features UNIVAC I emulation,  a  Chinese  character
set, 1401  incompatibility, and is expected to be all things
to few people some of the time.  The following partial  list
of instructions  illustrates  the vast potential of this new
computer.

As you can tell, this just  about  takes  care  of  a  well-
rounded hardware instruction  set.   We are now developing a
suitable operating system.  We  are  soliciting  suggestions
from our  user community for system calls (supervisor calls,
monitor requests, etc.)  to be incorporated in  the  initial
release version.   Already  suggested have been "Intersperse
Print Files", "Ignore System Console",  and  "Randomize  All
Passwords".

Please mail all suggestions to ICS105.
