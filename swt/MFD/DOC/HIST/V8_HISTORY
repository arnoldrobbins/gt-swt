$mntoc
#'Mntoc' returned an EOS, regardless of the default character set-

*Perry
$hd
#Added  -n  and -u options to control "normalization" of number of

#the logical disk number is unknown.
!Sunday, 02/01/81 15:48:55

*Perry
$sh
#Fixed  'file_type' in sh_exec.r to return the value UNKNOWN_FTYPE
#for a UFD.  This makes directories invisible to the  search  rule

*Perry
$print
#Added -i, -j and -l options to allow independent specification of
#indentation,  formfeed  generation and page length, respectively.

$who
#Modified to append an "r" to the process id of users connected to

#file.
!Friday, 02/13/81 17:25:56
*Perry
$mail
#Changed to use 'date' to get the login name of the sender instead
#of  the  =user= template.  This causes the senders name to appear
#in upper case in the postmark (the desired effect), and  prevents
#someone  from defining a private =user= template and sending mail
#from someone else (an unexpected bonus).
!Friday, 02/13/81 17:30:57

#before the day of week.

*Perry
$dprint
#Added  -c  option  to  allow  specification  of  multiple copies.
#Changed argument parsing code to use parscl.   This  necessitated
#changing the syntax for setting the form length from -<length> to
#-l <length>.  File arguments are now parsed by 'gfnarg'.
!Saturday, 02/14/81 14:47:58
*Dan
$sh
#Added  subclasses  to  internal  commands:  there is now a single
#letter subclass associated with each internal  command.   If  the
#flag  in  the  search  rule  for internal commands is "^int", the
#shell behaves as always.  If the flag is in the form "^int/<class
#letters>", internal commands with class  letters  in  the  string
#<class letters> *will not* be found when searching the commands.
#
#Modified  behavior  of  'svmake' (and hence 'declare'):  'svmake'
#will no longer change the value of a variable when it  is  called
#if the variable is declared at the current level.  'Declare' will
#also no longer modify a variable when it is re-declared.
!Saturday, 02/14/81 15:38:32

!Friday, 03/13/81 14:44:47
*Allen
$moot
#Installed  Roy's  modified  version  of 'moot' with the following
#changes:  (1) bug that caused illegal user names to  be  accepted
#at  login  has  been fixed; (2) 'index' command has been added to
#allow examination of subject headings of entries in a conference;
#(3) bug that set the  "last  reviewed"  conference  entry  to  an
#incorrect value has been fixed.
!Tuesday, 03/17/81 11:41:53
*Allen
$stacc
#(1)  sped  up operation by eliminating use of temporary files for
#actions.  (2) added ".epsilon" declaration and  "epsilon"  symbol
#to  match  the  null token, which turned out to be useful in some
#places to avoid  code  duplication.   (3)  added  "quick  select"
#right-hand-side, allowing fast selection of alternatives based on
#a  single  leading  terminal  symbol.  Quick select is enabled by
#placing a dollar sign ($) at the beginning of a  right-hand-side.
#Note the restrictions on this feature:  the first element of each
#alternative must be a single terminal symbol, optionally followed
#by  a  period  to  terminate  the lookahead scan; there may be no
#actions between the dollar sign and the first alternative;  there
#may  be  no  error  actions  specified  for  the terminal used to
#control alternative selection.

!Wednesday, 04/08/81 18:00:13
*Perry
$se
#Added  the  's'  option  and corresponding subroutine 'dosopt' to
#module 6.  This option allows simultaneous setting of  groups  of

$rp  (rp.stacc, rp_out.r)
#Added  a call to 'outdon' following the call to 'outgolab' in the

#Added  the  "-m" option to allow setting the number of lines used

$declared_cmd
#Declared used only one array to check for and store both the name
#of  the variable to be checked and its lexical level offset.  The
#getarg that attempted to get the offset  clobbered  the  variable
#name.   Also,  -1  was used to indicate that the level offset was
#larger than the lexical  level.   Because  the  return  value  of
#svfind  is  EOF  (=  -1)  if  the  variable  is  not defined, all
#variables were "defined" if the offset  was  too  large.   A  new
#array  was added for the second argument, and too large an offset
#is coded by ERR.

$sys$$
#Sys$$ was changed to fix a bug, such that when a phantom executed
#several commands with x (such as fc, or ld) it would only execute

$who
#Who  was  fixed  to  use  the  change that occurred in GMETR$ for
#primos 18.  GMETR$ now returns a packed string, instead of a PL/I
#varying string, and it also doesn't get the memory meters for the
#user, except if the key GM_MEM is called, and then  it  gets  the
#meters  for  ALL  users.   Because  of the change with the memory
#meters, the local mod to GMETR$  (to  avoid  getting  the  memory
#meters  for  individual  users)  wasn't needed, and this code was
#removed from who, also.

#file name was passed to 'gctoi', and a zero was  returned.   This
#caused  'tail'  to read the default number of lines from standard
#input, instead of reading it from the named file.
#
#A bug section was added for  the  'tail'  program  entry  in  the
#Reference  Manual  to  explain the situations in which tail still
#acts "funny".  Later, those bugs will probably be removed or tail

$=src=/std.r/template.r
#The  '-d' option has been eradicated from the source.  It was not
#referenced in some parts of the code, and seemed to be a  distant
#but intimate relation of the '-r' option.  Neither the usage mes-
#sage  in the program nor the help entry admitted to the existence
#of '-d' option, so no one will miss it.
!Monday, 01/25/82 00:51:07

#installed  new  verison of VTH library with the wrap_around field

#terminals  that  do  not wrap_around when end of line is reached.
#Terminals affected mainly NETRON and TVT.   Cleaned  up  all  the

*Dan
$se
#Installed  new  version  of  'se'  that understands hardware line
#insert/delete.
#
#New user-visible features:
#     'h' option to inform 'se' of terminal speed  (for  computing
#          delays).
#     revised  'h'  and 'om' commands (They work the way they used
#          to).
#     screen  positioning  on  terminals  with  insert/delete   is
#          somewhat different (especially with 'a' and 'c').
!Thursday, 02/25/82 22:07:05

$help
#Help  has  now  been  modified  to  use the 'page' routine in the
#library, instead of doing its own paging.  The benefits  of  this
#are  manyfold, the most significant of which is that the user may
#now back up while reading a long entry.  As far as I can tell, no
#other functionality of help has  been  hindered  by  making  this
#change.   Instead  of  directly printing the line after the over-
#strikes and margin characters are removed, the line is written to
#a scratch file;  after  all  lines  for  a  particular  piece  of
#documentation  have been processed, the page routine is called on
#that scratch file.
#
#Documentation will be modified to reflect the new functionality.

$swt_def.r.i, swt_def.s.i
