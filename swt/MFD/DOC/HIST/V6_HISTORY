$sh, getarg, ld
#Changed argument handling:
#   - 'Getarg'  extract  arguments  directly  from  shell's linked
#     string space.  Pointers are placed in the  common  block  in
#     argv  and  the first 32 words of buf.  Argument 0 is now ac-
#     cessible through 'getarg'.  Argc is 1 when no arguments  are
#     specified.
#   - 'Sh' now copies argument points into argv.  Buf is not used.
#   - 'Ld'  includes  the  symbol  definition  for  kp$ls  so that
#     programs using  'getarg'  from  the  unshared  library  will
#     correctly access the linked string space.

$mail, to
#An updated version of the function  'vfyusr'  (which  checks  the

$swt
#Fixed the bug that prevented 'swt' from creating a .vars file for

$se
#Bugs fixed:
#   - All problems associated with improper updating of the screen
#     after it has been split.
#   - Improper  updating  of  the screen when changing line 1 of a
#     file less than one screenful long.
#   - Substitution of the last line in the file  for  the  current
#     line when garbage collection occurs during a 's' or 't' com-
#     mand.
#     
#New features:
#   - Arbitrary tab stops.
#   - Inline character scans.
#   - Ability to enter ASCII control characters using the ESC key.
#   - Inline appends, changes and insertions.
#   - Global appends, changes and insertions.

*Perry
$se
#Fixed  the  bug that caused 'se' to go into an infinite loop when
#using the inline character  scan  control  characters.   Added  a
#feature  to save the last character scanned for; if the same scan
#control character is hit twice in a row, the last character scan-
#ned for is used for the scan.  Modified append mode  to  position
#the  window  more intelligently when the text being entered wraps
#from the bottom row to the top row.  Reinstated clearing  of  the
#row  below  the  command  row in append mode.  Fixed the bug that
#caused the current line to be incorrect after doing an  "e"  com-
#mand on a non-existent or unreadable file.

#system, as have the library routines 'sw$in' and 'sw$out'.
!Friday, 05/18/79 10:50:03
*Perry
$open.r
#Fixed 'open' so that it attempts to allocate an i/o buffer before
#it attempts to open the file.  If no buffer space  is  available,
#the  file  is  not  opened.   The  fact  that  it performed these
#operations in the reverse order  was  the  reason  that  'mktemp'
#would  occasionally  create 99 temporary files in /temp and still
#return an error.
#
#This change is to source code only; the library has not yet  been
#recompiled.

$stacc
#Installed first production version of 'stacc' in /bin.
#
#Changes from bootstrap version include:
#
#   - Rewriting of parser portion in 'stacc'.
#   - Addition of simple error recovery code.
#   - Rewriting of output routines to provide indented output code
#     and elimination of unused 'case' alternatives.
#   - Introduction  of  the  equals  sign (=) into terminal symbol
#     declarations, allowing two terminals to  be  interchangeable
#     (have the same lexical representation).
#   - Introduction of the "no advance" construct (a period after a
#     terminal  symbol)  which  prevents the automatic call to the
#     lexical analyzer after matching a terminal symbol.
#   - Change of the "action" character from sharp (#) to bang (!).
#   - Introduction of Ratfor-style comments, preceded by  a  sharp
#     sign (#) and continuing to the end of the line on which they
#     appear.
#   - Single  characters  enclosed  in single or double quotes may
#     now be used as terminal symbols.   They  are  replaced  with
#     their  Prime  ASCII  values,  and  so may be matched against
#     characters returned by Subsystem I/O routines.
#   - Terminal symbol definitions are output to standard output  2
#     rather than standard output 1.
#   - Definitions  for  the  three  parser  states  are now output
#     automatically.
#
#Reference manual entry updated.

$swtsrc
#Created  /swtsrc/stacc_progs  to  hold  Subsystem  programs  that
#require 'stacc' to be rebuilt.  Proper modifications were made to
#the  build_procedures.  /swtsrc/special_progs/hp.u was destroyed,
#since 'hp' now is properly assigned to stacc_progs.
#
#Conventions for programs in stacc_progs:
#
#   - The Ratfor code for a program using a 'stacc' parser  is  in
#     the file "program.r"
#   - The   'stacc'   code   for   the   parser  is  in  the  file
#     "program.stacc"
#   - The output  of  'stacc'  will  be  directed  to  two  files,
#     "program.stacc.r"  and "program.stacc.defs", which should be
#     'include'd in the Ratfor code as necessary.
#   - Any common block include files needed by the program  should
#     be in "program.com"

$se
#Rearranged  subroutines  in  'se'  in  hopes of providing greater

#
#Technique used:  compiled 'se' with profile option, then profiled
#several editing sessions consisting only of one editing operation
#(e.g.  file reading,  file  writing,  appending,  global  search,
#etc.).   Then  clustered  those routines with highest call counts
#for each operation.

#Source directory "/swtsrc/special_progs/se.u" was also rearranged
#somewhat, in particular each subprogram was placed in a  separate
#file in the subdirectory "source".
