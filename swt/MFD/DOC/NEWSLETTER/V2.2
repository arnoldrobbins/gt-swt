.ar "Status of SWT[bl]8"
In answer to your question
"WHERE IS SWT[bl 1]8???", it is
alive and well but moving rather slowly.
We apologize for miscalculating its release date.
Since none of us ever took a major part in
previous releases, we did not fully appreciate the
magnitude of  work required.
.pp
Let me give you a status report.
The Users's Guide and Reference Manual are completed --
awaiting a final proofread.
We are currently revising  the Manager's
Guide.
When completed, we will sit down
with the new documentation (with revision bars) and
write the conversion guide.
After that, we will move all the release material
to one place on disk and practice making and installing
release tapes until we are convinced that everything is
as it should be.
At that point it time, we will be able to make and mail
them to you.
.pp
We have set the goal of making release tapes for spring
quarter break, the week of March 22.
We cannot see any reason why we should not be able to
meet this deadline.
.pp
We have been keeping close contact with
Prime and the status of Primos 19.
We want to avoid a repeat of last year's occurrence
when we received Primos 18.1 long after it was
released.
The timely arrival of Primos[bl 1]19 coupled
with a support crew having experience with an entire release
should prevent the current situation
from ever arising again.
.pp
We appreciate (and even understand your lack of) patience.
We are working as hard as we can and will get this
release to you as soon as possible.
