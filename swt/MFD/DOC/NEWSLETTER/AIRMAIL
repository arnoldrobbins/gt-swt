.ar "Mailing Releases by Airmail"
Our policy is to mail release tapes and associated documentation
by regular (third class) mail.  If  you wish to receive
any of this material by air mail please make prior arrangements
with us for your payment of the airmail postage, e.g. send us
your Federal Express Number, an account number to which we can
charge, indicate that you would like it sent C.O.D. (not
applicable to customers located in other countries),
prepay us, or indicate that you would like us to bill you (there
will be a $5.00 billing charge).

For those of you wishing to prepay us, the release tape, conversion
guide, subsystem manager's guide and the cover letter weigh
approximately 3 pounds (1.3 Kg).
