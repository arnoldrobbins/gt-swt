                                   INTRODUCTION TO THE
                   GEORGIA TECH SOFTWARE TOOLS SUBSYSTEM USER'S GUIDE


                 The  documents following this Introduction comprise the most
            recent version of the User's Guide for the Georgia Tech  Software
            Tools  Subsystem  for Prime 350 and larger computers.  This Guide
            brings together in one  place  all  the  tutorial  and  reference
            information  useful  to novice and intermediate users of the Sub-
            system.  It deals with several  important  aspects  of  Subsystem
            use:   the  user interface in general, unavoidable aspects of the
            underlying operating system, and the most-frequently  used  major
            commands.    Each   topic  is  covered  in  a  separate  document
            (available individually) and all documents are collected together
            with this Introduction to form  the  Guide  itself.   Experienced
            users,  as  well  as  beginning  users  who  wish to expand their
            knowledge  of  the  Subsystem,  will  find  the  _S_o_f_t_w_a_r_e   _T_o_o_l_s
            _S_u_b_s_y_s_t_e_m _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _M_a_n_u_a_l valuable.

                 The development of the Georgia Tech Software Tools Subsystem
            was  originally  motivated by the text _S_o_f_t_w_a_r_e _T_o_o_l_s by Brian W.
            Kernighan and P. J. Plauger, Addison-Wesley, 1976.  That text  is
            still   the  basic  reference  for  the  tools  that  it  covers,
            particularly Ratfor, the text editor, the macro preprocessor, and
            the text formatter.
