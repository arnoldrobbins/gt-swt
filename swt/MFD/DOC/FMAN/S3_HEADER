                 This  section  is  devoted  to  the  description of locally-
            supported Subsystem commands.  Georgia  Tech's  locally-supported
          | commands reside in the directory "=lbin=" and are supplied on the
          | Software  Tools release tape as an interesting example of locally
          | developed commands.

                 Documentation for each command is organized under  the  fol-
            lowing  headings.   Note  that  a  heading  will be omitted if it
            contains no additional information.
