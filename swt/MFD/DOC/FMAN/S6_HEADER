                 This  section  is  designed  to  give  the  user  a  working
            knowledge of the  low  level  functions  and  subroutines.   This
            information  is supplied for informative purposes only, since the
            user should not invoke these routines directly under normal  cir-
          | cumstances;  appropriate  routines in sections two or four should
          | be invoked instead.  Each routine has  its  own  entry  organized
            under  the following headings.  Note that empty entries are omit-
            ted entirely.


                 _H_e_a_d_e_r _L_i_n_e

                      The subprogram's name, a synopsis of its  purpose,  and
                      the date of last modification to its documentation.

                 _C_a_l_l_i_n_g _I_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n

                      The  subprogram declaration and the declarations of its
                      arguments, as well as the name of the library in  which
                      it can be found.

                 _F_u_n_c_t_i_o_n

                      A description of the purpose of the routine, along with
                      the  interpretations  of its arguments and the returned
                      value (if any).

                 _I_m_p_l_e_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n

                      A short discussion of the strategy  used  to  implement
                      the routine, abstracted from the source code.

                 _A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s _M_o_d_i_f_i_e_d

                      Names of those arguments modified by the routine.

                 _C_a_l_l_s

                      Other subprograms called by this routine.

                 _B_u_g_s

                      Known problems with the use of the routine.

                 _S_e_e _A_l_s_o

                      References to further information or related routines.
