                 'News'  gives  Subsystem  users access to the Software Tools
                 Subsystem news service.  It has three basic functions:

                      1.   To print an index of currently active news items.

                           The "-i" option is available to perform this func-
                           tion.  The command "news -i" will print the index.
                           Each entry in the index is of the form:

                                <item_number> <date> <time> <headline>

                           The <item_number> is an integer which may be  used
                           to  select  specific  articles  to be printed (see
                           below).  The <date> and <time> are  the  date  and
                           time  at  which  the item was published.  (See the
                           documentation for  the  'publish'  command.)   The
                           <headline>  is a short description of the contents
                           of the news item.


                      2.   To print selected news items.

                           For each <item_number> (see  above)  specified  in
                           its argument list, 'news' will print a correspond-
                           ing  news item on standard output.  Available news
                           items may be determined by looking  at  the  index
                           generated by the "news -i" command.


                      3.   To print the news delivered to a subscriber.

                           Users may "subscribe" to the news service by using
                           the  'subscribe'  command.   Whenever a subscriber
                           logs in to the Subsystem (either at  Primos  login
                           or  through  the 'swt' command), he is informed if
                           any news item has been  published  since  he  last
                           checked   with  the  news  service.   If  news  is
                           available, he  should  type  the  command  "news",
                           without  arguments.   Recent  news  items  will be
                           printed, one CRT screenful at a time.   (The  user
                           may skip or re-examine the news at this point; see
                           manual  entries  for  'pg'  (1) and 'page' (2) for
                           further information.)   The  user  is  then  asked
                           whether  or  not  he wishes to save his news.  The
                           correct response is "n" or "N" for "no";  anything
                           else  causes the news to be saved.  News not saved
                           may still be retrieved through the usual  channels
                           outlined in steps 1 and 2 above.

                 If  the  user  does not specify the "-p" option and standard
                 output is directed to his terminal, 'news' will display  the
                 requested  articles  one  page at a time.  Otherwise, 'news'
                 will produce its output in a continuous stream.
