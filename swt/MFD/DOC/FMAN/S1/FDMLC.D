                 'Fdmlc'  serves as the Subsystem interface to the Prime DBMS
                 Fortran DML preprocessor (FDML).   It  examines  its  option
                 specifications  and  checks  them  for consistency, provides
                 Subsystem-compatible default file names for the listing  and
                 output files as needed, and then produces a Primos FDML com-
                 mand and causes it to be executed.

                 The  "-b"  option  is used to select the name of the file to
                 receive the output Fortran code from the preprocessor.  If a
                 file name follows the option, then that  file  receives  the
                 output.   If  the  option  is not specified, or no file name
                 follows it, a default filename is constructed from the input
                 filename by changing its suffix to ".df".  For  example,  if
                 the  input  filename  is  "prog.f",  the output file will be
                 "prog.df"; if the input filename is "foo", the  output  file
                 will be "foo.df".

                 The  "-l"  option  is used to select the name of the file to
                 receive the listing generated by  the  preprocessor.   If  a
                 file  name  follows  the option, then that file receives the
                 listing.  If the "-l" option is  specified  without  a  file
                 name following it or is not specified, a default filename is
                 constructed  from  the input filename by changing its suffix
                 to ".dl".  For example, if the input  filename  is  "gonzo",
                 the  listing  file will be "gonzo.dl"; if the input filename
                 is "bar", the listing file will be "bar.dl".

                 The input filename must be a disk file name  (conventionally
                 ending in ".f", ".f77", or ".ftn").

                 In  summary,  then, the default command line for compiling a
                 file named "file.f" is

                      fdmlc  file.f  -b file.df  -l file.dl

                 which corresponds to the FDML command

                      fdml -i *>file.f -b *>file.df -l *>file.dl

                 'Fdmlc' pays no attention to standard ports.
                 
                 There is no way to avoid getting both a listing  and  output
                 file.
