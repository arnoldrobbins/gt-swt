Version 8.1 to Version 9 Conversion Guide

.HE "Version 9 Conversion Guide"
.fo //- # -//
.MH Introduction
Version[bl]9 of the Subsystem is the last official
release of Software Tools.
We no longer have the manpower to support such a large amount of
software, and will probably not have Prime computers at all for
much longer.
We apologize for taking so long to get this release out; there
have been administrative, hardware and personnel problems (as outlined
in the newsletter), and only recently have things been straightened out.
.pp
As promised, this release does run under Primos 19.2, and does have
commands giving access to the new file system features
(ACLs, disk quotas, etc.).
There are many new features, and many improvements have been
made to the major Subsystem programs.  Version 9 of Software Tools
is a major release; we're going out with a bang, not a whimper!
.pp
This conversion guide is divided into three sections:
[bf Global[bl]Changes] discusses the alterations
that affect large portions of the user interface;
[bf Status[bl]of[bl]V8.1[bl]Commands] and
[bf Status[bl]of[bl]V8.1[bl]Subroutines] describe
additions, deletions, and modifications made to individual commands
and subroutines.
.#
.MH "Global Changes"
.SH "The Subsystem Common Block"
The Subsystem common block has been moved.
It now starts at Segment '4040, Word '10000.
It has also been somewhat re-arranged.
Any program which references the Subsystem common should be recompiled.
This includes any programs compiled with the Georgia Tech C Compiler
(for those of you who have it), since the C run time library, "ciolib"
currently references the Subsystem common.
This will be fixed in the next release of the C compiler,
which is now in preparation.
.#
.SH "New Subsystem Libraries"
Three new libraries have been added to the Subsystem for Release 9.
The first, "vswtmath", is a library of high precision mathematical routines.
These routines, along with some interesting facts about Prime's
floating point hardware and software, are documented in the
.ul
SWT Math Library User's Guide.
The second library, "vshlib", contains several routines which give
the programmer access to the shell, and its variables.
The third library, "vrnglb", is used by the 'Ring' set of programs.
This library is undocumented, and unsupported.
.#
.SH "Deleted Subsystem Libraries"
The old, locally supported math library, "vswtml",
has been changed slightly (routines which were obsoleted by
"vswtmath" were removed), and merged in [ul with] "vswtmath";
"vswtml" has been deleted.
The Virtual Terminal Handler library, "vthlib",
has been merged in with standard Subsystem library, and is
therefore no longer needed.
Programs which used "vthlib" should have the "-l vthlib"
removed from whatever build procedures are used to load them.
The Version[bl]8 compatibility libraries,
"v8vswtlb", and "nv8vswtlb",
are no longer supported, and have been deleted.
You should remove them from =lib= and recompile any programs
which needed them.
Finally, "gtnetlb" has been deleted.
.#
.SH "New Subsystem Templates"
There are several new Subsystem templates.
The first is =new_words=.
If this template is defined, the 'spell' program
will treat it as the file where it will
write out any words that it finds which are not in the dictionary.
Currently, this template is commented out, but if you want 'spell'
to start keeping a word list, remove the comment symbol.
This is particularly useful to help enhance the Subsystem dictionary.
See the help on 'spell' for more details.
.pp
=ring= is the directory where the 'Ring' programs will write their
log files.
.pp
=histfile= is the file which the shell will use to save user
command sessions.  This allows preserving the shell's history
across login sessions.
.pp
=cldata=:  There is a commented out entry which will apply for
Revisions 19.4 and later of Primos (once they are released).
The current entry is for Revisions 18.3 through 19.3 of Primos.
.pp
=crondir= is the directory where 'cron' creates temporary files
for the phantoms it creates.
=cronfile= is the file containing the directives for 'cron'.
.#
.SH "Command Interpreter Enhancements"
There have been many enhancements to the shell.  In particular,
we have added a "history" mechanism, which allows the user to
recall previous commands, search for them, and modify them.
.pp
The shell can now do continuous checking on the user's mail box,
so if mail arrives during a session, the user is notified.
.pp
Also, the shell has a looping capability with the
repeat-until construct.  This greatly increases the shell's power,
making it much easier to write shell programs.
.pp
There have been other changes to the shell as well.
The details are too numerous to be listed here;
we recommend a careful reading of the
.ul
User's Guide to the Software Tools Command Interpreter.
.pp
The enhanced error handling mentioned in the newsletter did
not make into the shell; there simply was not enough time to make
all the changes.  The other features are more useful, anyway.
.#
.SH "Shell Variables"
The format of the shell variables save file has changed
for this release.  To ease the burden of conversion,
we have provided a command 'csv' (Convert Shell Variables)
which reads a list of user names on its first standard input,
and reformats the corresponding variables files.
Do a 'help csv' for details and instructions.
.#
.SH "Command Interpreter Source Code Location"
Since the shell is now callable as a subroutine, with a library of
associated routines, its source code has been moved from
=src=/spc/sh.u/?* to =src=/lib/sh/?*.
This should not affect the operation of the Subsystem;
but it is a change worth noting.
.#
.SH "The =userlist= File"
The format of =userlist= has changed.
Since Primos 19.2 now allows 32 character login id's,
the entries in =userlist= look slightly different.
The
.ul
Software Tools Subsystem Manager's Guide
discusses this in further detail, including some
advice on converting the old format file into the new one.
.#
.SH "Update to SWTSEG"
The Subsystem segmented loader has been updated to Primos version 19.2.
It still only understands eight character names. Oh well.
.#
.SH "Enhanced Editors"
Both the 'ed' line editor, and the 'se' screen editor have
been greatly enhanced.
Since the editors are probably the most used programs in the
Subsystem, the changes are described here as a 'global change',
even though only two actual commands have been changed.
.pp
The guide and help pages have been updated
to reflect the changes made to the editors.  The following list
applies to both editors:
.in +5
.ta 4
.bu
Trailing delimiters are not needed in pattern searches, or
for the 's', 't', and 'j' commands.
.bu
The 'j' commands defaults to 'j/ /p', and the 's' command
defaults to 's//&/p'.
.bu
Global commands can be set to continue, even if the command
fails for a given line.
.bu
You may escape to the Software Tools shell from within the editor.
(See the help on the 'shell' subroutine for more discussion of this
feature.)
.bu
The saved replacement pattern can be empty. I.e., if you
deleted a pattern in the last substitute, you may do so again with
's//&/', or simply 's'.
.bu
A new command, "l" (for "location") is available.
This command prints out the first line of the file =installation=.
In other words, you can find out what machine you are using from
within the editor.  This feature is designed for multiple-machine
installations, where a user can switch back and forth between
machines, and forget where he is at a given moment.
.sp
.in -5
The following list applies only to the 'se' screen editor.
.in +5
.bu
'Se' now has an auto-indent option.
This makes typing in program text considerably easier.
.bu
'Se' reads commands from the file =home=/.serc (if it exists)
whenever it starts up.  This is useful for setting personal options.
.bu
'Se' will allow you to use UNIX style pattern characters and
command letters.  This is useful for new Subsystem users who are
already familiar with the UNIX system.
.bu
The help files in =doc=/se_h/?* have [ul finally] been updated
and completed.  There is now a help file for every command and
every option in the screen editor (believe it or not!).
The help command will call up help appropriate to either UNIX mode
or normal mode, whichever is being used at the time.
.in -5
.#
.SH "Documentation Changes"
The Reference Manual macros have been changed to include the section
number in the header line of each page, as well as in the footer.
This is particularly useful with the 'usage' command; you can see
what section of the manual a command or subroutine is in,
as well as how to use it.
.#
.SH "Dynamic Templates"
With Rev 19 of Primos, projects are supported in the operating system.
Template handling has been revised to make =home= the initial
directory to which you are attached for each project.
This is computed dynamically, instead of being in a static file.
Since =ubin= is defined as =home=/bin, this allows users to have
different private bins for each login project.
.#
.MH "Status of Version 8.1 Commands"
This section summarizes the user-visible changes that have been made
to the Subsystem commands for Version 9.
It is divided into several subsections:
obsolete commands, superseded commands, modified commands,
enhanced commands, and unchanged commands.
The final subsection is a summary of commands that are new
for the Version 9 release.
.#
.SH "Obsolete Commands"
The commands in this subsection were part of the Version[bl]8.1
Subsystem, but are not included in the Version[bl]9 release.  Most
of them were used only by certain shell programs and have outlived
their usefulness.  In other cases, the commands were relics of past
Subsystems, and either were no longer useful, or no longer worked.
.sp
.in +10
.cm memstat
The memory status monitor has been removed due to changes in Primos.
It required Georgia Tech modifications to Primos, which haven't
been made at Georgia Tech for Rev. 19.2.
Since it required Georgia Tech Primos, it was not very
useful at other sites anyway.
.cm mkusr
This program was used at Georgia Tech for creating new
users.  Since it requires Georgia Tech modifications to Primos,
and since the production machines at Georgia Tech are not
running Rev. 19.2 (only the development machine is),
this program has been deleted.
.cm old_ar
The old archiver has been removed since there is no longer any use
for it.
.cm rmusr
This program was used at Georgia Tech for removing existing users.
See the comments above under 'mkusr'.
.in -10
.#
.SH "Superseded Commands"
The commands in this subsection are not part of the Version[bl]9
Subsystem; their functionality has been subsumed by other
commands.  Each entry describes the command and options you
can use to get the same results.
.in +10
.sp
.bf
No commands are superseded at Version 9.
.in -10
.#
.SH "Modified Commands"
The commands listed in this subsection have been modified for the
Version[bl]9 release and are no longer completely compatible
with their Version[bl]8.1 counterparts.
Each entry gives a brief description of the changes, but
before using any of these commands, please check the corresponding
Reference Manual entry to be sure of the command's exact behavior.
.in +10
.cm cat
Has been changed to loudly complain when it can't open a file.
For those who want it to be meek and quiet, there is a new "-s"
(for "silent") option.
.cm history
Is now used exclusively for making entries in the Subsystem
history file.  It no longer takes any options and does not call 'phist'.
.cm lf
By default, does [ul not] list files whose names begin with a '.'.
To see "dot files", use the "-a" option.
.cm pword
Changes the user's login passwords.  Password checking with
no echoing and more than six characters on
login is now a standard feature of Primos.
Because of this, 'pword' has been moved from the "locally supported"
section to the "standard commands" section.
.cm sema
Has a new option "-i" for initializing named semaphores.
Also now uses the standard Subsystem argument notation.
.in -10
.#
.SH "Enhanced Commands"
Commands in this subsection have been functionally enhanced for the
Version[bl]9
release, but remain compatible with their Version[bl]8.1 counterparts.
.in +10
.cm del
Fixed to handle new file ACL's.
.cm dprint
Has a new "-x" option which prevents the initial page eject.
.cm ed
See the "Global Changes" section above, and the Reference Manual
entry on 'ed', as well as the
.ul
Introduction to the Software Tools Subsystem Text Editor
for details.
.cm find
Has a new "-i" option to ignore case in comparisons.
.cm fmt
Has been greatly enhanced.  There are more
special characters, more commands, and more function calls.
Particularly useful is the condition handling mechanism -- [bf .if].
.cm help
Uses the 'page' subroutine, with the VTH option.
A new option, "-d", indicates that the user has a "dumb"
terminal, and therefore 'help' should not use VTH.
Fixed a bug whereby an EOF status did not tell 'help' to
stop, if it was showing multiple help items.
.cm ld
Has a new option, "-w" (short for "wierd"), for loading programs
compiled with Prime's C compiler.  The "-b" option has changed
slightly to handle the next release of the Georgia Tech
C compiler.
This change should not affect
.# famous last words!
those of you who are using
the current release of the C compiler.
.cm pg
Uses the VTH option of the 'page' subroutine for paging.
See the Reference Manual entry for both the 'pg' command
and the 'page' subroutine for more information.
.cm se
Handles more terminal types,
as well as the changes outlined under "Global Changes" above.
.cm sep
Changed to use "cat -s", which effectively keeps its
behavior identical to earlier versions.
.cm sh
Vary many enhancements.
See the User's Guide for details.
.cm source
Fixed to handle archives correctly.  'Source' will find the source
for more than one command and/or subroutine.
.cm spell
Has been made slightly smarter about suffixes, in particular, it
will strip a trailing "'s" before checking a word in the dictionary.
Also, if =new_words= is defined, 'spell' will write any unknown words
there.
.cm stacc
Supports three new languages; Pascal, PL/1, and Plp,
in addition to Ratfor and C.
.cm who
Has two new options; "-l" for user locations,
and "-p" for user projects.
These two options are mutually exclusive.

.MH "Status of Version 8.1 Subroutines"
This section summarizes the user-visible changes to
the Subsystem library routines.
It is divided into several subsections:
obsolete routines, superseded routines, modified routines,
enhanced routines, unchanged routines and new routines.
.SH "Obsolete Routines"
The routines listed here were only used by other library
routines.  Since their services are no longer required, they
have been deleted.
.in +10
.sp
.bf
No routines were obsoleted at Version 9.
.in -10
.#
.SH "Superseded Routines"
The following routines have been subsumed by other more powerful
routines. Each entry names the Version[bl]9 routine that performs
the same function.
.in +10

changes that have been made, you should examine the corresponding
Reference Manual entries to determine the exact behavior
of the routines.
.in +10
.cm init
Prints an error message
and then exits to the Subsystem.
It remains only to help users find programs which need recompiling.
.cm tcook$
Has been greatly enhanced.  The calling sequence has changed.
