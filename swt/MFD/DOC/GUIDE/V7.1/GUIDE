.MH Introduction
Version 7.1 of the Software Tools Subsystem contains corrections  to
many
problems found in Version 7, as well as a several enhancements
and new features.
Version 7.1 is almost completely compatible with Version 7; it
does not require the recompilation or relinking of any object
programs.  Other than the addition of new commands, there
are few user-visible changes.
.pp
If you require total compatibility, you will find that most
Version 7 commands
will run unchanged under the Version 7.1 Subsystem.
You may thus replace offending Version 7.1 commands with
their Version 7 counterparts by simply copying the old
version into =bin= or =lbin=.
.SH "New Command Directory"
The directory =ebin= (nominally //extra/bin) has been added
to contain object files that are executed from shell programs
in =bin=.  Programs now residing in this directory include the
compiler, loader, and batch interludes, and some programs
used by the bug reporting mechanism.
Ratfor source for the programs residing in =ebin= is kept in
=src=/ext.r; the source for shell programs in =ebin= resides
in =src=/ext.sh.
.SH "Line Editor Library"
The subroutine 'edit' in the library 'vedtlb' invokes the
Subsystem line editor on a file specified in the call.
This routine is useful for interactive programs that allow
significant changes to internal text files.
.SH "Compiler Interludes"
A number of Primos compilers and assemblers (F77, FTN, PASCAL,  PL1G,
and PMA) can be invoked from the Subsystem.  We have attempted
to provide a consistent interface to each compiler through
the use of table-driven interlude that can be adapted to
the requirements of each compiler.  In the future, we expect
to provide interfaces to Prime's other compilers.
.SH "Execution from Segment Directories"
The Subsystem will now load and execute programs directly
from SEG-compatible segment directories.  Segment directories
can be created with 'ld' or directly by the user.  Since
'cp' and 'del' treat segment directories as files, the use
of segment directories as program files should be transparent.
.SH "Shell Statistics"
The shell will now record all commands it executes if the
template "=statistics=" is set to "yes".  Analysis of the
shell statistics files can give a good deal of insight
into how a user community actually uses the Subsystem.
.MH "Status of Version 7 Commands"
This section summarizes the user-visible changes that have been made
to Subsystem commands for Version 7.1.
It is divided into several subsections:
obsolete commands, superseded commands, modified commands,
enhanced commands, and unchanged commands.
The final subsection is a summary of commands that
are new for the Version 7.1 release.
.SH "Obsolete Commands"
The commands in this subsection were part of the Version 7 Subsystem,
but are not included in the Version 7.1 release.  Most of them
were used only by certain shell programs and have outlived
their usefulness.  In the other cases, the commands were relics
of past Subsystems, and either were no longer useful, or no
longer worked.

.ta 6
.tc \
.cm who2
Was originally part of 'who'.  Since 'who' was rewritten, it
has no further use.
.in -10
.SH "Superseded Commands"
The commands in this section are not part of the Version 7.1
Subsystem;  their functionality has been subsumed by other
commands.  Each entry describes the command and options
you can use to get the same results.
.in +10
.cm fl
Use fcl.
.cm pl1c
Use "plgc".
.cm pl1cl
Use "plgcl".
.cm pc
Use "p4c".
.cm pcl
Use "p4cl".
.cm save
Use "vars -s".
.in -10
.SH "Modified Commands"
The commands listed in this section have been modified for the Version
7.1 release and are no longer completely compatible with their Version 7
counterparts.
Each entry gives a brief description of the changes, but
before using any of these commands, please check the corresponding
Reference Manual entry to be sure of the command's exact
behavior.
.in +10
.cm crypt
The encryption algorithm has been changed to produce only
printable characters.  The encryption key can now be typed
without printing it on the terminal.
.cm fc
The option syntax has been radically changed.
All Primos compiler interludes now have consistent option
syntax.
.cm find
The "-n" option is now "-l".  File names can be read from
standard input. Order of flag options is no longer
important.

.cm moot
Has been made significantly more useable.
.cm news
Displays news articles using the "page" subroutine.
.cm pg
Uses the 'page' subroutine.
.in -10
.SH "Enhanced Commands"
Commands in this section have been functionally enhanced for
Version 7.1, but remain compatible with their Version 7
counterparts.

.cm os
Significantly faster.
.cm pause

.cm phist
A new option allows an arbitrary history file to be input.
New option allows selection on author.  New option allows
suppression of text.

modifications.

modification.
No longer generates a redundant STOP after a CALL SWT.
.cm se
Supports Heathkit H19 and Netronics terminals.
Requests confirmation for the destruction of a file
with the "w" command.
.cm sep
Files containing 'rp' and 'fc' options will now be included
in the compilations.
.cm sh

Can directly execute SEG-compatible segment directories.
.cm stats
Now sorts and saves data points only when necessary for
statistics requested.
.cm tail
A negative integer argument passes all but the first 'n' lines.
.cm to
The date and time are included in the message
heading line.
.cm vars
The variables file can be saved and restored on arbitrary
files.
.cm who
'Who' has been rewritten to be of use on systems other
than Georgia Tech.
.cm xref
Prints more intelligible diagnostics; collates upper and
lower case letters together.
