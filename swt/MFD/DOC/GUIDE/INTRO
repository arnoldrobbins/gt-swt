INTRODUCTION TO THE
GEORGIA TECH SOFTWARE TOOLS SUBSYSTEM USER'S GUIDE
.sp
.pp
The documents following this Introduction comprise the most recent
version of the User's Guide for the Georgia Tech Software Tools
Subsystem for Prime 350 and larger computers.
This Guide brings together in one place all the
tutorial and reference information useful to
novice and intermediate users of the Subsystem.
It deals with several important aspects of Subsystem use:
the user interface in general, unavoidable aspects of the underlying
operating system, and the most-frequently used major commands.
Each topic is covered in a separate document (available individually)
and all documents are collected together with this Introduction to
form the Guide itself.
Experienced users, as well as beginning users who wish to expand their
knowledge of the Subsystem,
will find the [ul Software Tools Subsystem Reference Manual] valuable.
.pp
The development of the Georgia Tech Software Tools Subsystem
was originally motivated by the text
.ul
Software Tools
.sb
by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger,
.xb
Addison-Wesley, 1976.
That text is still the basic reference for the tools that it covers,
particularly Ratfor, the text editor, the macro preprocessor,
and the text formatter.
