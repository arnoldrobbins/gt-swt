.MH "Screen Editor Options"
Options for 'se' can be specified in two ways:  with the
"o" command or on the Subsystem command line that invokes 'se'.
To specify an option
with the "o" command, just enter "o" followed immediately by
the option letter and its parameters.  To specify an option on the
command line, just use "-" followed by the option letter and its
parameters.
With this second method, if there are imbedded spaces in the parameter
list, the entire option should be enclosed in quotes.  For
example, to specify the "a" (absolute line number) option
and tab stops at column 8 and every fourth thereafter with the
"o" command, just enter
.be
oa
ot 8 +4
.ee
when 'se' is waiting for a command.
To enter the same options on the invoking command line, you might
use
.be
se -t regent myfile -a "-t 8 +4"
.ee
.pp
The following table summarizes the available 'se' options:

Option[tc]Action
.sp
.in +10
.HI 10 a
causes absolute line numbers to be displayed in the line number area
of the screen. The default behavior is to display upper-case letters
with the letter "A" corresponding to the first line in the window.
.HI 10 c
inverts the case of all letters you type (i.e., converts
upper-case to lower-case and vice versa). This option causes
commands to be recognized only in upper-case and alphabetic line
numbers to be displayed and recognized only in lower-case.
.HI 10 d[<dir>]
selects the placement of the current line pointer following
a "d" (delete) command. <dir> must be either ">" or "<".
If ">" is specified, the default behavior is
selected: the line following the deleted lines becomes the new
current line.  If "<" is specified, the line immediately preceding
the deleted lines becomes the new current line.  If neither is
specified, the current value of <dir> is displayed in the status
line.
.HI 10 f
selects Fortran oriented options. This is equivalent to specifying
both the "c" and "t7 +3" (see below) options.
[cc]mc |
.HI 10 g
controls the behavior of the "s" (substitute) command when it is under
the control of a "g" (global) command.  By default, if
a substitute inside a global command fails, 'se' will not continue
with the rest of the lines which might succeed.
If "og" is given, then the global substitute will continue, and lines
which failed will not be affected.  Successive "og" commands
will toggle this behavior.
An explanatory message is placed in the status line.
[cc]mc
.HI 10 h[<baud>]
lets the editor know at what baud rate you are receiving characters.
Baud rates can range from 50 to 19200; the default is 9600.
This option allows the editor to determine how many, if any,
delay characters (nulls) will be output when the hardware line
insert/delete functions of the terminal are being used (if available).
Use of the built-in terminal capabilities to insert/delete lines
speeds up editing over slow-speed lines (i.e., dialups).
Entering 'oh' without an argument will cause your current baud
rate to appear on the status line.
[cc]mc |
.HI 10 "i[a | <indent>]"
selects indent value for lines inserted with "a", "c" and "i"
commands (initially 1).  "a" selects auto-indent which sets the
indent to the value which equals the indent of the previous line.
If <indent> is an integer, then the indent value will be set
to that number.
If neither "a" nor <indent> are specified, the current value
of indent is displayed.
.HI 10 k
Indicates whether the current contents of your edit buffer
has been saved or not by printing either a "saved" or
"not saved" message on your status line.
.HI 10 l[<lop>]
sets the line number display option.
Under control of this option, 'se'  continuously displays
the value of one of three symbolic line numbers in the status line.
<lop> may be any of the following:
.in +5
.ta 6
.HI 5 .
display the current line number
.HI 5 #
display the number of the top line on the screen
.HI 5 $
display the number of the last line in the buffer
.in -5
.ta 11
.sp
If <lop> is omitted, the line number display is disabled.
[cc]mc
.HI 10 lm[<col>]
sets the left margin to <col> which must be a positive integer.
This option will shift your entire screen to the left,
enabling you to see characters at the end of the line that
were previously off the screen; the characters in columns
1 through <col> - 1 will not be visible.  You may continue
editing in the normal fashion.  To reset your screen enter
the command 'olm 1'.
[cc]mc |
If <col> is omitted, the current left margin column
[cc]mc
is displayed in the status line.
.HI 10 "m[d] [<user>]"
[cc]mc |
displays messages sent to you by other users (via the 'to' command)
while you are editing.  When a message arrives while you
are editing, the word "message" appears on your status line.
[cc]mc
To send other users messages while inside of the editor,
you can insert
the text of your message into the edit buffer, and
then issue the command "line1,line2om[bl]<user>",
where "line1" and "line2" are the first and last lines,
respectively, of where you appended your message in the edit
buffer and "<user>" is the login[bl]name or process[bl]id of the
person to whom you want to send a message.  The given lines
[cc]mc |
are sent and deleted from the edit buffer.  To prevent the lines
from being deleted after they are sent, use the command line
[cc]mc
"line1,line2omd[bl]<user>"
[cc]mc |
.HI 10 "p[s | u]"
converts to or from UNIX (tm) compatibility mode.
The "op" command, by itself, will toggle between normal
(Software Tools mode) and UNIX mode.
The command "opu" will force 'se' to use UNIX mode,
while the command "ops" will force 'se' to use Software
Tools mode.
.sp
When in UNIX mode, 'se' uses the following for its patterns and
commands:
.in +5
.ta 6
.HI 5 "?pattern[?]"
searches backwards for a pattern.
.HI 5 ^
matches the beginning of a line.
.HI 5 .
matches any character.
.HI 5 ^
is used to negate character classes.
.HI 5 %
used by itself in the replacement part of a substitute command
represents the replacement part of the previous substitute command.
.tc
.HI 5 "\(<regular expression>\)"
tags pieces of a pattern.
.HI 5 \<digit>
represents the text matched by the tagged sub-pattern
specified by <digit>.
.HI 5 \
is the escape character, instead of @.
.HI 5 t
copies lines.
.HI 5 y
transliterates lines.
.HI 5 ~
does the global exclude on markname
(see the "!" command, in the help on 'ed').
.HI 5 "![<Software Tools Command>]"
will create a new instance of the Software Tools shell, or
execute <Software Tools Command> if it is present (see the "~"
command, in the help on 'ed').
.in -5
.ta 11
.sp
All other characters and commands are the same for both UNIX and
normal (Software Tools) mode.  The help command will always call
up documentation appropriate to the current mode.
UNIX mode is indicated by the message "UNIX" in the status line.
.sp
UNIX mode is available [ul only] in 'se'.  This extension
is not available in 'ed'.
[cc]mc
.HI 10 "s[pma | ftn | f77 | s | f]"
sets other options for case, tabs, etc.,
for one of the three programming languages listed.
The option "oss" is the same as "ospma" and the
option "osf" is the same thing as "osftn" (the corresponding
command line options are "-ss" and "-sf").
If no argument is specified the options effected by this
command revert to their default value.
.HI 10 t[<tabs>]
sets tab stops according to <tabs>.  <tabs> consists of
a series of numbers indicating columns in which tab stops
are to be set.  If a number is preceded by a plus sign ("+"),
it indicates that the number is an increment; stops are set
at regular intervals separated by that many columns, beginning with
the most recently specified absolute column number.  If no such
number precedes the first increment specification, the stops are
set relative to column 1.
By default, tab stops are set in every third column starting with
column 1, corresponding to a <tabs> specification of "+3".
If <tabs> is omitted, the current tab spacing is
displayed in the status line.
.HI 10 u[<chr>]
selects the character that 'se' displays in place of
unprintable characters.  <chr> may be any printable character;
it is initially set to blank.  If <chr> is omitted, 'se' displays
the current replacement character on the status line.
.HI 10 v[<col>]
sets the default "overlay column".  This is the column
at which the cursor is initially positioned by the "v" command.
<Col> must be a positive integer, or a dollar sign ($) to indicate
the end of the line.  If <col> is omitted, the current overlay
column is displayed in the status line.
.HI 10 w[<col>]
sets the "warning threshold" to <col> which must be
a positive integer. Whenever the cursor is  positioned at or
beyond this column, the column number is displayed in the status
line and the terminal's bell is sounded.
If <col> is omitted, the current warning threshold is displayed
in the status line.
The default warning threshold is 74, corresponding to the first column
beyond the right edge of the screen on an 80 column crt.
.HI 10 -[<lnr>]
splits the screen at the line specified by <lnr> which must
be a simple line number within the current window.  All lines above
<lnr> remain frozen on the screen, the line specified by <lnr> is
replaced by a row of dashes, and the space below this row becomes
the new window on the file. Further editing commands do not affect the
lines displayed in the top part of the screen.  If <lnr> is
omitted, the screen is restored to its full size.
