.SH "Usage"
'Fmt' takes as input a file containing text with interspersed
formatting instructions.
It is invoked by a command with various optional parameters, discussed
below.
The resultant output is appropriately formatted text suitable for
a printer having backspacing capabilities.
The output of 'fmt' is made available on its first standard output
port, and so may be placed in a file, sent to a line printer,
or changed in any of a number of ways, simply by applying
standard Software Tools Subsystem I/O redirection.
.pp
When 'fmt' is invoked from the Subsystem, there are
several optional parameters that may be specified to control
its operation.  The full command line syntax is
.be
fmt [ -s ] [ -p<first>[-<last>] ] { <file name> }
.ee
A brief explanation of the cryptic notation:
the items enclosed within square
brackets ("[]") are optional -- they may or may not be
specified; items enclosed between
braces ("{}") may occur any number of times, including
zero; items enclosed in angle brackets ("<>") designate
character strings whose significance is suggested by the
text within the brackets; everything else should be taken
literally.
.pp
And now for an explanation of what these parameters mean:
.ta 11
.in +10
.HI 10 -s
If this option is selected, 'fmt' will pause at the top
of each page, ring the bell or buzzer on your terminal,
and wait for a response.  This feature is for the benefit
of people using hard-copy terminals with paper not having
pin-feed margins.
The correct response, to be entered after the paper is mounted, is a
control-c (hold the 'control' key down and type 'c').
.HI 10 "-p ..."
This option allows selection of which pages of the
formatted document will actually be printed. Immediately
following the "-p", without any intervening spaces, should
be a number indicating the first page to be printed.
Following this, a second number may be specified, separated
from the first by a single dash, which indicates the
last page to be printed. If this second number is
omitted, all remaining pages will be produced.
.HI 10 <file>
Any number of file names may be specified on the
command line.  'Fmt' will open the files in turn,
.nh
formatting
.hy
the contents of each one as if they constituted one big file.  When the
last named file is processed, 'fmt' terminates.  If no
file names are specified, standard input number one is used.
In addition, standard input may be specified explicitly
on the command line by using a dash as a file name.
.in -10

.SH "Commands and Text"
'Fmt', like almost every other text formatter ever written,
operates on an input stream that consists of a mixture of
text and formatting commands.
Each command starts at the beginning of a line with a 'control
character', usually a period, followed by a two character name,
in turn followed by some optional 'parameters'. There must not
be anything else on the line.  For example, in
.be
 [bf .ta] 11 21 31 41
.ee
the control character is a period, the command name is [bf ta],
and there are four parameters: "11", "21", "31" and "41".
Notice that the command name and all the parameters must be
separated from each other by one or more blanks.
Anything not recognizable as a command is treated as text.
