.mh "Foreword"
The Georgia Tech C compiler and run time support library provide
a C programming environment on Prime computer systems.
The Georgia Tech C Compiler runs under and [bf requires] the Georgia
Tech Software Tools Subsystem, Version 9 or later.  Both
run on PRIME 400, 500 and 50-series computers.

This guide documents the second version of the Georgia
Tech C compiler and run time library which is released with
Version 9 of the Software Tools Subsystem.  The eight chapters of

A complete description of C can be found in
[ul The C Programming Language] by Brian W. Kernighan
and Dennis M. Ritchie (Prentice-Hall, 1978).
Further information on individual commands in the C
system can be obtained from the
[ul Software Tools Subsystem Reference Manual], accessible
both on paper and through the Subsystem 'help' command.
The C run time library is only documented here.
There are no 'help' entries for the individual
subroutines.

Wherever a routine or facility has been changed from the
first release of the C compiler, it will be explicitly
noted as such.
