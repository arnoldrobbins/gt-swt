.MH "Online Documentation"

Users, old and new alike, often find that their memories need jogging
on the use of a particular command. It is convenient, rather than
having to look something up in a book or a manual, to have the computer
tell you what you want to know.
Two Subsystem commands, 'help' and 'usage,' attempt to address
this need.

.SH "The 'Help' Command"
.#
.#
The 'help' command is designed to give a comprehensive description of
the command in question.
The information provided includes the following:
a brief, one-line description of what the command does;
the date of the last modification to the documentation;
the usage syntax for the command
(what you must type to make it do what you want it to do);
a detailed description of the command's features;
a few examples; a list of files referenced by the command; a list
of the possible messages issued by the command; a list of the
command's known bugs or shortcomings; and a cross reference of
related commands or documentation.
.pp
'Help' is called in the following manner:
.be
help command-1 command-2 ...
.ee
If help is available for the specified commands, it is printed; otherwise,
'help' tells you that no information is available.
.pp
'Help' will only print out about as many lines as will fit on most CRT screens,
and then prompt you with a message ending "more?".
This allows you to read
the information before it rolls off the screen, and also lets you stop
getting the information for a command
if you find you're not really interested.
To stop the output, just type an "n" or a "q" followed by a NEWLINE.
To continue, you
may type anything else, including just a NEWLINE.
.pp
Several special cases are of interest.  One, the command "help" with no
arguments is the same as "help general", which gives general information
on the Subsystem and explains how to use the help command.
Two, the command "help[bl]-i"
produces an index of all commands supported under the Subsystem, along
with a short description of each.
Finally, "help[bl]bnf" gives an explanation of the conventions used
in the documentation to describe command syntax.

Examples of the use of 'help':
.be 5 [set 1 0]
.ta 52
] [bf help]\([num +1])
] [bf help -i]\([num +1])
] [bf help rp ed term]\([num +1])
] [bf help bnf]\([num +1])
] [bf help guide]\([num +1])
.fi [set 1 0]
.ta 6
.HI 5 ([num +1])
General information pertaining to the Subsystem, along with an
explanation of the 'help' command, is listed on the terminal.
.HI 5 ([num +1])
A list of currently supported commands and subprograms,
each with a short description, is listed on the terminal.
.HI 5 ([num +1])
Information on the Ratfor preprocessor, the Software Tools text editor,
and the terminal configuration program is printed on the terminal.
.HI 5 ([num +1])
A description of the notational conventions used to describe
command syntax is printed.
.HI 5 ([num +1])
Information on how to obtain the Subsystem User's Guides is
listed on the terminal.

Since beginning users frequently find printed documentation helpful,
you may find the following procedure useful.
Unfortunately, it involves many concepts not yet discussed, so it
will be rather cryptic;
nevertheless, it will allow you to produce a neatly-formatted copy
of output from 'help'.
.be 3 [set 1 0]
.ta 52
] [bf help -p | os >/dev/lps/f]\([num +1])
] [bf help -p rp se term | os >/dev/lps/f]\([num +1])
] [bf help -p -i | os >/dev/lps/f]\([num +1])
.fi [set 1 0]
.ta 6
.HI 5 ([num +1])
The general information entry is printed on the line printer.
.HI 5 ([num +1])
Information on the Ratfor preprocessor, the screen editor, and the
terminal configuration program is printed on the line printer.
.HI 5 ([num +1])
The index of available commands and subprograms is printed on the
line printer.
.ee

.SH "The 'Usage' Command"
.#
.#
Whereas 'help' produces a fairly comprehensive description of the
command in question, the 'usage' command gives only a brief summary
of the syntax of the command.
The syntax is expressed in a notation known as Backus-Naur Form
(BNF for short) which is itself explained by typing "help[bl]bnf".
.pp
The 'usage' command is used in the same way as the 'help' command,
as the following examples illustrate.
.be 2 [set 1 0]
.ta 52
] [bf usage usage]\([num +1])
] [bf usage fmt help]\([num +1])
.fi [set 1 0]
.ta 6
.HI 5 ([num +1])
The syntax of the 'usage' command is printed.
.HI 5 ([num +1])
Usage information on the Software Tools text formatter and the
'help' command is printed.
