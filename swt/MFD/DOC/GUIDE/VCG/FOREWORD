.CH "Foreword"
Although the School of Information and Computer Science has operated
Prime 400 and 550 computers for over four years, as yet
there has been no successful local attempt to produce a compiler for
them.
The main reasons for this failure are the irregularity of the
architecture and existing system software, the complexity
of Prime's standard object code format, and the lack of documentation
on matters of importance to compiler writers.

This paper discusses the design, implementation, and usage of
a re-usable code generator.
This program can serve as a common "back-end" for a number of
language translators, producing 64V-mode assembly language code
suitable for execution on the P400 and higher numbered processors
in Prime's "50" series.
Furthermore, it could be tailored to match specific front-ends,
when needs for special optimizations
arise.

A preliminary version of the code generator is available for
general use.
