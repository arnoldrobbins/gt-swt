The Software Tools Subsystem is a set of program development tools
based on the book
.ul

.sb
by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J.

Plauger.
It was originally developed for use on the Prime 400 computer in
1977 and 1978 in the form of several cooperating user programs.

The present Subsystem, the ninth version, is a powerful tool that

aids in the effective use of computing resources.

The command interpreter, also referred to as the
"shell,"
is a vital part of the Subsystem.
It is a program which accepts commands typed by the user on his terminal
and converts them into more primitive directions to the computer itself.
The user's instructions are expressed in a special medium called the
"command language."
The greatest part of this document is involved with describing
the command language and giving examples of how it is used.

Three areas will be covered in the following pages.
First, there is a tutorial on the use of the command language.
New Subsystem users should read this chapter first.
Some minimal knowledge of terminal usage is assumed;
if you are unsure of yourself in this area, see Prime's published
documentation and the
.ul
Software Tools Subsystem Tutorial
for help.
Second, there is a summary of the syntax and semantics of the
command language.
Experienced users should find this chapter valuable as a reference.
Finally, there is a selection of application notes.
This chapter is a good source of useful techniques and samples of
advanced usage.
Experienced users and curious beginners should find it well
worthwhile.
