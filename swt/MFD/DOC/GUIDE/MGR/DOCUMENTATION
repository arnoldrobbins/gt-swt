.MH "Documentation Structure"
Given a question about the Subsystem, where does one go in order to
find the answer?
This section attempts to address this problem,
at least to the extent of enabling the Subsystem Manager to identify
the document required and produce a printed copy of it if needed.
.pp
Software Tools Subsystem documentation is divided into two parts:
the Reference Manual and the User's Guide. The Reference Manual
is mostly technical information:  usage summaries, listings of differences
from standard [ul Software Tools] programs, etc.
The User's Guide
is mostly "soft" information:  tutorials, applications notes, and the
like.
Each has its place, and must be accessed in its own way.
.SH "Reference Manual"
The Reference Manual
is normally the first port of call for anyone seeking an answer to
a specific question.
The Manual is composed of a number of entries, one for each command
or subprogram in the Subsystem, divided into six sections:
standard (i.e., supported by Georgia Tech) commands, standard
subprograms, local (i.e., supported by the local installation, or not
at all) commands, local subprograms, low-level commands, and low-level
subprograms.
The Manual is indexed by a simple list of entries and by an
automatically generated key-word-in-context index.
.pp
A copy of the Reference Manual,
formatted for 8.5" by 11" paper at 10
characters per inch horizontal, 6 lines per inch vertical,
may be spooled for printing with the command
.be
=doc=/print/man
.ee
Frequent use of this command is not recommended because of the manual's
sheer size.

.pp
Individual Manual entries may be printed with the 'help' command.
Simply typing
.be
help <command-name>...     or
help <subprogram-name>...
.ee
will cause the selected Manual entries to be printed on the user's
terminal, with a pause between each screenful.
The user may also type
.be
help -p <command-name> | os >/dev/lps/f
.ee
to obtain a printed copy of an entry exactly as it appears in the
Manual.
.pp
'Help' may also be used to read the Manual's index.
If "-i" is used in place of a command name, then the Manual's index
will be printed.
If "-f <pattern>" is used in place of a command name, then only
those index entries matching the given pattern will be printed.
For example, all commands and subprograms whose Manual entry
heading lines contain the word "string" could be identified by
typing
.be
help -f string
.ee
This may be useful for people just learning to use the Subsystem,
who may know several names for a function they wish to perform,
but not the exact command or subprogram they need.
.pp
An unformatted copy of the Reference Manual
resides in the directory "=doc=/man".
A formatted version resides in "=doc=/fman".
Should it ever be necessary to rebuild the formatted version,
simply type
.be
=doc=/build/man
.ee
.SH "User's Guide"
The Guide is recommended for anyone just learning to use the
Subsystem, as well as for those requiring a deeper knowledge of
the workings of some of the more complex tools.
It is actually a collection of separate papers, arranged roughly
in the order required by a novice user.
It is not intended as a quick reference; the Reference Manual
performs that function.
.pp
Most papers in the Guide contain a tutorial section and an
applications notes section, for beginners and experienced users,
respectively.
Some papers also contain a formal definition section;
these would be of use only to those requiring a very complete
understanding of the workings of the Subsystem.
.pp
The entire User's Guide,
formatted for 8.5" by 11" paper, 10
characters per inch horizontal, 6 lines per inch vertical,
may be spooled for printing by executing the following command:
.be
=doc=/print/guide
.ee
The Guide is small enough that this operation is not overly expensive
in terms of time or paper.
.pp
The 'guide' command may be used to print the individual papers that
comprise the Guide.
For example,
.be
guide ed
.ee
would print the
[ul Introduction to the Software Tools Text Editor]
on the user's terminal, pausing after each screenful.
To obtain a printed copy instead, one should type
.be
guide -p ed | os >/dev/lps/f
.ee
It is generally good policy to have a number of copies of the
[ul Software Tools Subsystem Tutorial]
and the
[ul Introduction to the Software Tools Text Editor]
on hand for distribution to new users.
.pp
An unformatted copy of the User's Guide
resides in the directory "=doc=/guide".
Should it ever be necessary to rebuild the formatted copy in
"=doc=/fguide", it can be done by typing
.be
=doc=/build/guide
.ee
