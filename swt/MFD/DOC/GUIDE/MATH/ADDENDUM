.MH Introduction
For Release 9 of the Software Tools Subsystem,
in order that there should only be one math library,
the old, locally supported, math library, "vswtml",
has been merged with the new library described in this report,
"vswtmath".
This addendum describes these routines.
.MH "Deleted Functions"
The functions
[ul dacos],
[ul dasin],
[ul dbexp],
[ul dbsqrt],
[ul dflot],
and
[ul drand],
have all been deleted from "vswtml", since there are new
routines to take their places.
.MH "Remaining Routines"
The following pages contain the Software Tools Reference Manual
entries for the remaining routines which have been added to
"vswtmath" from "vswtml".
.pp
Note that although the original "vswtmath" routines are listed
in Section 2 of the SWT Reference Manual, these routines are listed
in Section 4, even though they are all in one library.
