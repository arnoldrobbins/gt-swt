If the given symbol is not present in the symbol table, 'delete'
does nothing; this condition is not considered an error.

'Delete' calls 'st$lu' to determine the location of the given symbol
in the symbol table.
If present, it is unlinked from its hash chain.
The dynamic storage space allocated to the symbol's node is returned
