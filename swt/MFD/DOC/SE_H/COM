                                   Commands

        When  the "cmd>" prompt appears near the  bottom of the screen,
        a command may be typed.  Commands work  for the most  part  the
        same way as commands to 'ed', the Software Tools Subsystem text
        editor with which you may be familiar.

          To return to the general help directory, type "hdir".
          For information about specific commands, type "hcomdir".
          For details on command syntax, type "hcomsyn".
