        oh -- Option How-fast

        default range                syntax
             n/a                       oh[<baud>]

        "oh"  lets the editor know at what baud rate you are receiv-
        ing characters.  Baud rates can range from 50 to 19200;  the
        default is 9600.  This option allows the editor to determine
        how  many,  if  any, delay characters (nulls) will be output
        when  the  hardware  line  insert/delete  functions  of  the
        terminal are being used (if available).  Use of the built-in
        terminal capabilities to insert/delete lines speeds up edit-
        ing  over  slow-speed  lines (i.e., dialups).  Entering 'oh'
        without an argument will cause your  current  baud  rate  to
        appear on the status line.

        For general information about the option command, type "ho".
        See also "hln" for how lines can be referred to in commands.
