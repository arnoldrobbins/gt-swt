                                Line Numbers

        A  LINE  NUMBER  refers  to  a line in the edit buffer.  The
        lines are always numbered sequentially starting with  1.   A
        line  number can be expressed as an integer, as "."  meaning
        the CURRENT LINE, "^" or "-" meaning  the  line  before  the
        current  line,  "$"  meaning  the  last  line,  as a PATTERN
        enclosed in "/" slashes for a forward  scan,  as  a  pattern
        enclosed  in  "?"   question marks for a backward scan, as a
        MARK NAME preceeded by "<" for a backward search or  by  ">"
        for  a forward search, or as any additive combination of the
        above by joining them with operators "+",  "-",  or  nothing
        (meaning "+").

        Type "hlist" for line number list syntax.
        For details on scans and searches, type "hscan".
