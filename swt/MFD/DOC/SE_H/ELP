                                     Help

        You are using 'se', the  Georgia  Tech screen editor which  is
        based upon the editor described in the book SOFTWARE TOOLS, by
        Brian W.  Kernighan  and  P.   J.   Plauger  (Addision-Wesley,
        1976).   The  screen-oriented  modifications (and some others)
        are by  Jack  Waugh and  Perry  Flinn.  Most of this 'help' is
        courtesy of Bob Gordon of Prime Research, as amended by Arnold
        Robbins.  The description before you now is invoked by the "h"
        (help) command.

        For a description of the 'help' command, type "hh".
        Find out what the help command can tell you - type "hdir".
