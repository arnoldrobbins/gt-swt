        ok -- Option OK

        default range                    syntax
          1,$                             ok

        Typing  "ok"  simply tests the flag that indicates whether the
        edit buffer has been saved since the last change was  made  to
        it.   "Saved"  or  "Not saved" is accordingly displayed in the
        remark field at the bottom of the screen.

        To return to the option directory, type "ho".
        See also "hq".
