                       Miscellaneous Control Characters

         CTRL-Z toggles an indicator that acts as a "shift lock",
         controlling case mapping on alphabetics typed.

         CTRL-Q signals the editor that you suspect that for some
         reason the screen is garbaged.  The response is to clear and
         restore the screen.


         Type "hcc" to get back to the control character directory.
