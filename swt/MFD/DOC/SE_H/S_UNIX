          s    -- Substitute command

               default range           syntax
                   .,.           s/change-this/to-this[/][g]

        The pattern "change-this" is matched on each line  within  the
        range  and the string "to-this" is substituted for it.  If [g]
        is used, all occurrences  of  the  "change-this"  pattern  are
        changed.   If  "change-this" is empty, the most recent pattern
        from this command (e.g.  within the range field) or a previous
        command is used.  If "to-this" is a '%', the previous replace-
        ment pattern is used.  The trailing "/" is optional.  The  "/"
        may be any character.

        To return to the command directory, type "hcomdir."
        See also:  "hln" and "hpat".
