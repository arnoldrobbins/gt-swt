        The "=" command displays the last  line  number  in  the  line
        number  list  (default  ".")  as  a  number.  For example, "="
        prints the line number of the current line, or "$=" prints the
        line number of the last line (the number of lines).

        The ":"  command, with no preceeding line numbers,  moves  the
        window  so that the next screenful of text is visible.  With a
        line number, it makes the window begin at the referenced line.
        The top line in the window becomes the current line.
