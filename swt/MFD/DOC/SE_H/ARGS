                             Argument Handling

        The syntax for 'se's invoking command is usually given as
             se [-t <terminal type>] {-<option> | <pathname>}
        but this is not entirely correct because whereas "-<option>"
        can  be  "-t", "-t" in the first argument position is always
        interpreted to mean that the terminal type follows.   It  is
        suggested  that  you set up a .serc file in your home direc-
        tory that will automatically turn on the  options  that  you
        like.    The   Subsytem's   "e"   command  can  be  used  to
        automatically keep track of what file you have been  working
        with.

        For a typical .serc file as suggested above, type "hserc".
        To see how the remaining arguments are treated, type "harg2".
        For details about <terminal type>, type "htt".
        To return to the general help directory, type "hdir".
