        serc -- =home=/.serc -- Se Initialization File

        The file =home=/.serc, if it exists, is read when se starts up.
        If a line begins with a '#',  it is treated as a comment and is
        ignored.  It is useful for  setting  personal  options  without
        the  user having to type them in  on the command line  or use a
        special shell file or alias. Here is a sample .serc file:

            # turn on unix mode, tabs every 8 columns, auto indent
            opu
            ot+8
            oia

        Command line options ALWAYS override anything done by the .serc
        file.
