        of -- Option Fortran

               default range             syntax
                  1,$                      of

        Typing  "of"  turns  on  a  package  of   options   considered
        convenient  for  editing  Fortran.  Case mapping is turned on,
        lower case line letters are selected,  (if  "oa"  hasn't  been
        toggled for absolute line numbers) the ruler is turned on, the
        warning  column  is  set to 72, and tab spacing is set to 6 so
        that tabbing once gets you to column 7.  To undo  "of"  it  is
        necessary to type "oc", and "ot3".

        For general information about the option command, type "ho".
        See also "oa".
