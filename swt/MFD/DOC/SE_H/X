          x    -- Global exclude on pattern

               default range           syntax
                         1,$           x/pattern/command

        "x"  is  used  to perform an editing command on all lines that
        do not match the "pattern". "pattern" is any legal pattern and
        command is an editor command.  The "g" command is the converse
        of "x" and performs the command on all lines that do match the
        pattern.  The "/" may be any character.

        To return to the command directory, type "hcomdir."
        See also:  "hg" and "hpat".
