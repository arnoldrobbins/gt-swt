             default range           syntax
                  n/a           f [file name]

        "f"  is  used to print or reset the name of the current file
        being edited.  f [file name] resets the name for the current
        file.  This filename is used by the "w", "e", and  "r"  com-
        mands  when  no  parameters are provided.  f does not change
        the "ok" toggle.  f with no parameters prints out the remem-
        bered name.

        To return to the command  directory,  type  "hcomdir."   See
        also:  "he", "hw", "hr", and "hok".
