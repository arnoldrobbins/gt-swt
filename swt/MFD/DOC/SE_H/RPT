        The CTRL-F ("Funny Return") key  can  be  used  for  repeating
        lines while in Append Mode or in Command Mode.  Typing it will
        cause   the   line  to  be  terminated  without  chopping  any
        characters off, and will set a flag that will inhibit  erasure
        of  the  command  after it is completed, so that the same line
        may be easily re- entered.


        Type "htermchar" for info about other termination characters.
        Type "habt" to see what CTRL-F does in overlay mode.
