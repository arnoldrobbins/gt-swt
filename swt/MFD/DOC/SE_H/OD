        od -- Option Delete

               default range             syntax
                  1,$                     od[<|>]

        The "d" option is for Delete direction.  Typing "od<" fixes it
        so  that  after  you  give  a "d" command, the line BEFORE the
        group of lines deleted becomes the current line  (.).   Typing
        "od>"  resets  the  normal behavior, in which the current line
        pointer is always positioned AFTER the group of lines  deleted
        by  the "d" command, if possible (Deleting the last line makes
        the new last  line  the  current  line).   Typing  "od"  alone
        queries  the  delete  direction flag, causing ">" or "<" to be
        displayed.

        For general information about the option command, type "ho".
