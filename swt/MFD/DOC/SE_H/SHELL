
        ~ --- shell escape

        default range                            syntax
                 1,$                      ~[<SWT command>]

        If  <SWT  command>  is present, it is passed to the Software
        Tools shell to be executed.  Otherwise, an interactive shell
        is created.  A leading !  is replaced by the previous  shell
        command.   Thus  ~!   executes  the  previous  command.   An
        unescaped % is replaced by the saved file name.  An expanded
        shell command is echoed before it  is  executed.   After  an
        interactive  shell exits, the screen is immediately redrawn.
        If a command was run, the results are left  on  the  screen,
        and  the  user must type a return to redraw the editing win-
        dow.

        To return to the command directory, type "hcomdir".
