          h    -- Help command

               default range           syntax
                         n/a           h[ null | parameter]

        Typing  "h"  followed  by any character string simply displays
        the contents of the se help script of that name at the top  of
        the  screen  (provided  the  script  exists).  The scripts are
        files in the directory '=doc=/se_h'.   If  the  scriptname  is
        omitted, "elp" is assumed.

        To see a general directory of help scripts, type "hdir".
