        o-  -- Option - (dash)

               default range             syntax
                  1,$                     o-[line number]

        The "-" option controls the placement on the screen of  a  row
        of dashes, which normally is off the screen above the top line
        or  hiding  behind  the  bottom line of the help display.  The
        "window" through which you look at the edit buffer is the por-
        tion of the screen BELOW the  row  of  dashes  but  above  the
        command  line  (when  it exists) or status line at the bottom.
        "o-" alone puts the row of dashes above  the  top  line;  "o-"
        followed  by a SINGLE TERM line number puts it in place of the
        line referred to on the screen, if possible.

        For general information about the option command, type "ho".
