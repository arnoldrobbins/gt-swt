          c    -- Change command

               default range           syntax
                    .,.                  c

        "c"  first  deletes  the range of lines determined by the line
        numbers (default ".,."), then enters append mode so  that  you
        can  type  lines to replace the deleted lines.  Append mode is
        terminated with a dot on a line by itself, as with the  Append
        command. "c:" works as a one line change (i.e. what  is  after
        the colon replaces the current line).

        To return to the command directory, type "hcomdir."
