                            List (of line numbers)

        A  line  number list consists of one or more LINE NUMBERs sep-
        arated with commas or semicolons.  The last two  line  numbers
        in  the  list  usually  specify  the  scope of a command.  For
        example, "5,7d" means delete lines 5 through 7.  If  the  list
        consists  of  only one line number, it is equivalant to a list
        with that line number written twice with a  comma  separating.
        The  sense of the semicolon is to set the CURRENT LINE POINTER
        to the value of the line number before  the  semicolon  before
        evaluating  the  line  number after it, whose value may depend
        upon the value of the current line pointer.

        For command syntax, type "hcomsyn".
        For LINE NUMBER syntax and semantics, type "hln".
