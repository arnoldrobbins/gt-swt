.sp
You  are  using the Software Tools Subsystem, developed as a
human-engineered alternative to Primos.
.sp
Commands are of the form:
.sp
.ti +5
command parameter ...
.sp
where "command" is the name of a program, and "parameter" is
any string of characters.  Each individual  command  defines
the syntax of any parameters it may allow or require.
.sp
Program  names  are specified by 'pathnames', which describe
paths through directories and subdirectories  to  particular
files.  Pathnames have the form:
.sp
.ti +5
/packname/directory:password/.../file
.sp
where most components are optional.  Examples:
.sp
.in +5
//src/std.r
.br
/system_pack/lib:secret/ftnlib
.br
myprog
.br
subdir/myfile
.in -5
.sp
Complete information on pathnames and other aspects of the
file system may be found in the
[ul User's Guide to the Primos File System].
You can read this guide by typing the command:
.sp
.ti +5
guide fs
.sp
A copy will be printed, one page at a time, on your terminal.
.sp
Similarly, you can get quick information about any command by using the
'help' command; simply type:
.sp
.ti +5
help command_name
.sp
and information on the specified command will be printed on
your   terminal.    Typing   "help"   alone   produces  this
documentation.  For an index of the standard commands
and library subprograms with a brief description of each, type:
.sp
.ti +5
help -i
.sp
For a description of the meta-language used to describe  the
syntax of commands, type:
.sp
.ti +5
help -g bnf
.sp
'Help' prints out a page at a time and then asks
"<name>[bl][<number>+][bl]more[bl]?[bl]", where <name> is
the name of your request to 'help' and <number> is the number
of the pageful that 'help' has printed to you for that request.
If you want to see another screenful, simply type a carriage
return.  If you lose interest in what 'help' is telling you,
type "n" followed by a carriage return.
.sp
When you are ready to end your terminal session, simply type
.sp
.ti +5
bye
.sp
after  the "]" prompt and wait for the LOGOUT message to
appear.
