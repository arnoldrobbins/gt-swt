The following files are lists of words:
   dictionary......ordinary English words
   single-letters..single letters and zero length word
   gazetteer.......names and trademarks
   abbreviations...abbreviations
   glossary........computer science terms

The file 'build' merges them all together to generate the file
'words', which is used by the 'spell' command and the (now
obsolete) 'speling' command.

The file 'new_words', when it exists, contains words that have
not been looked up in a real dictionary or otherwise validated.
The subdirectory 'new' is a convenient place for splitting the
contents of 'new_words' out into the appropriate files.
