# this file consists of comments, which *MUST* have a # in column one
# and the names of files (without suffix) in the order they are to
# be loaded in the libraries.  They are split into 3 lists
#
# File list1 --- routines which call no other C routines, and which
#                are not called by any other C routines
#
# File list2 --- routines which call other routines but are not called
#                and routines which call other routines, and are called
#                themselves
#
# File list3 --- routines which call no other routines but which are
#                called by others, plus the shift shortcalls put out
#                by vcg, and the data for the C I/O library.
