 Additions/Modifications to SWT programs :
 
 lps  -  put in an option to allow the user to modify the queue
            entry corresponding to his own print file.  Allow
            the user to modify such things as count, forms code,
            defer time, and destination.  Also, "-c" specified
            with a login_name should delete all files for that
            login_name.
