Re: ph

Description:

    the process spawned by ph does not run in the directory where it was
started from, but in the home directory of the user. I tried to rebuild
my version of the screen editor by doing a 'ph sep se -all' while in the
directory /uc/arnold/se.u/se.u.  When I logged in later, I found an
se.f and an se.b in my *home* directory. The se.f file had just the
C --- long name map    line in it, and nothing else.
     AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
