'Remark' is a routine from
.ul
Software Tools
that is used to print messages on the error output file (ERROUT).
The single argument is either a packed, period-terminated character
string (e.g. a Fortran Hollerith literal), or an unpacked,
EOS-terminated string (the standard Subsystem variety).
In either case, the given string is printed on ERROUT, followed by
a NEWLINE.
.im
If the high-order byte of the first word of the string is non-zero,
then the string must be packed;
'remark' uses 'putlit' to write the string to ERROUT.
Otherwise, 'remark' uses 'putlin' to write the string.
Finally, 'putch' is called to print the trailing NEWLINE.
