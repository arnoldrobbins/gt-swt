'Getccl' converts the character class specification starting at
'arg(i)' into a pattern element starting at 'pat(j)'.
The pattern element consists of a character count followed by
a list of all characters in the class.
The function return is OK if the character class was successfully
converted, ERR otherwise.

If the first character in the class specification is a tilde,
the class generated is a negated class rather than the standard
class.
Room is then reserved for the character count,
and 'filset' is called to expand the specification into the
vector of characters.
