'Getch' is used to get a character from a file.  The first argument is assigned
the value of the character fetched; the second argument is the file descriptor
of the file to be read.  If end-of-file occurs on the input file, the character
returned is EOF.
The function return is always identical to the first argument (character read
or EOF).
.im
'Getch' calls 'getlin' with a very short line buffer (1 character + EOS).
'Getlin' thus returns one character in the buffer, which becomes the
value returned by 'getch'.
If 'getlin' returns EOF, 'getch' also returns EOF.
