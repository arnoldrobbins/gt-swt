Library: vswtmath (Subsystem mathematical library)

This routine calculates the hyperbolic cosine of its argument,
defined as cosh(x) = [exp(x) + exp(-x)]/2.  The absolute value of
the argument must be less than 22623.630826296.
The condition SWT_MATH_ERROR$ is signalled if there is an argument error.
An on-unit can be established to deal with this error; the SWT Math
Library contains a default handler named 'err$m' which the user may
utilize.
If an error is signalled, the default function value is zero.
