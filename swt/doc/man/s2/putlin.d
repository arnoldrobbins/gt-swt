'Putlin' is the primary Subsystem output routine.  The character string
supplied as the first argument is placed on the file specified by the
second argument.  The function return is OK if the write was successful,
ERR otherwise.
.im
'Putlin' first calls 'mapsu' to map any standard unit which may have been
supplied on the call to a file descriptor.
The file specified by this descriptor is checked to insure writeability.
If the last operation on the given file was not a 'putlin',
'flush$' is called to place the file's buffer in the empty state.
Depending on the device type associated with the file, one of the device
dependent drivers 'dputl$' (for disk files) or 'tputl$' (for terminal files)
is called to perform the actual data transfer.
No data transfer takes place for the null device (/dev/null).
The function return is
the value returned by the device dependent driver chosen, and is OK for
a successful transfer, ERR for an unsuccessful transfer.
