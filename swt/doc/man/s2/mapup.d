'Mapup' is the inverse of 'mapdn'.  If the character 'c' is a lower case
letter, the function return is the corresponding upper case letter; otherwise,
the function return is the same as 'c'.
.im
In 'mapup', as in 'mapdn', considerable use is made of the internal ASCII
character code.  If 'c' is between 'a'c and 'z'c, 'c' - 'a'c + 'A'c is
returned; otherwise, 'c' is returned.
