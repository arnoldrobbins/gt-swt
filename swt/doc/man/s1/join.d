'Join' reads its first standard input, replaces all NEWLINEs
with the <delimiter> string, and writes the result on its first
standard output.  The <delimiter> argument may be specified as
any arbitrary string.  If it is omitted, a single blank is assumed.
If the "-l<nlines>" construct is specified, a maximum of <nlines>
input lines will be joined into each output line.
