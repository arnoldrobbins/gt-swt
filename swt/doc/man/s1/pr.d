line printer.

Files to be printed are specified by <file_spec>s; see
'cat' for further information on the semantics of this construct.

Spooler control options may appear on the command line, but must
be separated from file names by an argument consisting only of a
slash.
See 'sp' and the library routine 'open' for further information on
