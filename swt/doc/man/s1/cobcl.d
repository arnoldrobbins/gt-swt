'Cobcl' is a shell file that invokes the Primos Cobol compiler
and the Primos segmented loader.
The program is compiled and linked in 64V mode.
[cc]mc |
If 'cobcl' is invoked with no <program name> argument,
it automatically processes the last program edited,
since it shares the shell variable 'f' with the shell program 'e'.
[cc]mc
The name of the file containing the program to be compiled must end
with ".cob", although in <program name> it may be specified with
or without the ending ".cob".
If no output file is specified in the <'ld' options>, the output
object file name will be <program name> with no extension.
.sp
Concerning the options,
'Cobc' will be called with the <'cobc' options> specified on the
command line; then 'ld' will be called with the <'ld' options>
specified.
