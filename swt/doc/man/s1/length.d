'Length' may be used to determine the length (in characters)
of a string or of all the lines in standard input.
If an argument is specified on the command line, its length
is printed on 'length's first standard output port;
otherwise, lines are read from the first standard input port
until end-of-file, with the length of each being printed
after reading.
When lines are taken from standard input, the NEWLINE at the end
of each line is not included in the printed length.
