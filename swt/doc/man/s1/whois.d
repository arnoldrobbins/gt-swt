'Whois' is used to determine the name of the user associated with
a particular login name.
The most frequent usage is "whois <login_name>", which looks up the login
name specified and prints the name of its owner.  If the "-" option is
specified, 'whois' prints the entire name list.  If no argument is given,
'whois' accepts a list of login names from standard input and prints the
name of the owner of each.
