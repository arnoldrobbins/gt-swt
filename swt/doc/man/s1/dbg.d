dbg { <DBG option> } <program> { <arguments> }

'Dbg' allows the user to access the facilities of the
Primos source level debugger (DBG) while still in the Subsystem.
<Program> is a Subsystem program that has been linked
by 'ld' with the "-d" option (i.e., it is a segment directory).
'Dbg' sets up the standard input and output ports and <arguments>
for access by the program and then executes DBG with a call
to Primos routine CP$.

"command too long" for too many DBG options to fit on a
Primos command line.

.bu
If DBG bombs (as it has been known to do), the Subsystem must
be reinitialized with the sequence "dels all;dels 6002" and
then "swt".
.sp
Ratfor programs must be debugged using the Fortran names
and line numbers (yuk!).

.sp
When DBG terminates (with the "q" command) it exits to PRIMOS. Typing
"ren" will return back to the subsystem.
