'Bs' is a shell file that executes the program 'guess'
when a command is not found in a user's search rule.
'Guess' is a program that
tries to find a command "close" to one that was mistyped.
This shell file may be added to the end of a user's search rule
so that it can aid a fumble-fingered typist.
