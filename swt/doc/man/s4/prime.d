'Prime' is used to retrieve a specified prime number.
The argument is the ordinal of the prime number desired.
The function return is the specified prime.
For example, if 'i' is 1, the function return is 2;
if 'i' is 3, the function return is 5, etc.
.sp
'Prime' uses the table of prime numbers in the file
"=aux=/primes".
This file contains the prime numbers up to one million in
long-integer binary format.
If "=aux=/primes" is unreadable or if 'i' is less than one
or greater than 78498, the function return is zero.
.im
The file "=aux=/primes" is opened for reading.
The read/write pointer for the file is then moved to the
desired location and the prime number read.
The file is then closed.

Should probably raise cain if the prime numbers file is not
available, rather than meekly returning zero.
