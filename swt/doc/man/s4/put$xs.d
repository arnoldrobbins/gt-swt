using highly efficient indexing and byte swapping operations.
The byte is assumed to be the least significant byte of 'char'.
.im
Implemented as a simple PMA routine entered via a JSXB (shortcall).
.sp
Note that any routine using this call must be compiled using the
"-q" option of 'fc'.

array
.bu
Does no bounds checking on the array (standard FTN problem),
but this may also be seen as a good point.
.sp
Locally supported.
.sa
fc (1), get$xs (4)
