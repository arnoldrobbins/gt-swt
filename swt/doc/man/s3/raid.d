'Raid' allows a user to examine bug reports submitted
with the 'bug' command.  'Raid' expects to find a variable
named 'lastbug' in the global environment (you can create
it by entering "set lastbug = 0") containing the number of
the last bug report examined.  If the "-a" option is
present, 'raid' prints all bug reports; otherwise it
prints only those reports that have not been seen.
If the "-p" option is present, 'raid' spools the bug
for printing; otherwise, they are displayed on the terminal
with 'pg'.
