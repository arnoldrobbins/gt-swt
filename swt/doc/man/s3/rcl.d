rcl <program> [ <ld arguments> ]
.ds
'Rcl' is a shell file that causes the specified Ratfor program
to be preprocessed, compiled and loaded.
The source file is expected to be named <program>.r
and the output object code is named <program>. Default
options are used on all processors.
[cc]mc |
If 'rcl' is invoked with no <program> argument,
it automatically processes the last program edited,
since it shares the shell variable 'f' with the shell program 'e'.
[cc]mc
.sp
If <ld arguments> are present, they will be presented to the loader
following
the main program binary file.   This allows the inclusion of subroutine
and library files in the object program.
