.ds
'Show' concatenates the contents of the files specified in its
argument list, replacing any imbedded non-printing characters
with printable representations, and writes the result on its first
standard output.
Normally, the non-printing characters are displayed as digraphs
consisting of a caret ("^") followed by an uppercase letter or
punctuation character.
However, if the "-m" option is specified, non-printing characters
are represented as their ASCII mnemonics enclosed in angle brackets
(e.g., a NEWLINE would be represented as "<LF>").  If the "-o"
option is specified, the characters are displayed as a caret
followed by three octal digits.
