'Lib' is used to concatenate the object code files produced
by the 'as6800' and 'as8080' cross-assemblers.
This is usually done to generate a library suitable for use
by the link editor 'lk'.
.sp
If arguments are given on the command line, 'lib' concatenates
the named files and places their concatenation on the file "lib.out".
Otherwise, file names are taken from standard input, and their
contents are concatenated and placed on "lib.out".
