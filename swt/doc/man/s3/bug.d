'Bug' allows users to report any problems they may encounter
with system commands or libraries.
It creates a standardized report whose existence is announced
to the system administrator at each login until
the report is examined.
'Bug' prompts for such information as the user's name,
a description of the bug, and the name of any file (e.g., program
source code or comoutput file) which helps illustrate the bug.
