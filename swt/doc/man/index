.pp
This section of the Manual contains a key-word-in-context
index produced from the headers of sections 1 through 6 with the commands
'kwic', 'sort', and 'unrot'.
.pp
Each line begins with the name of a command or subroutine,
followed by the (parenthesized) number of the section in which
it is documented.  The lines are duplicated and rotated so that
each keyword in the line appears to the right of the vertical
white space that runs down the center of the page.
