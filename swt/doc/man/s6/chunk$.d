'Chunk$' expects the segment directory to be open on 'fd'
(a Primos file descriptor).  It opens the file in
the segment directory at position 'seg + 2' and
reads 2048 words into memory at position pointed to by 'bp'.
The function return is OK if the read was successful, and ERR if
any errors occur.
