'Vt$get' is responsible for reading characters from the terminal
and interpreting the special characters. The first two arguments
are the
'row' and 'column' at which to start accepting input. The third
argument is the start of the input area on the current row,
and the fourth argument is the length of the input area.
'Vt$get' will continue reading from the terminal until a
line termination character is input (RETURN, KILL_RIGHT_AND_RETURN,
MOVE_UP, or MOVE_DOWN). The function return is the termination
code. Any macros are expanded by a call to 'vt$idf'.
