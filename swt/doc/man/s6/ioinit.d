scratch.

'Ioinit' sets the erase character, kill character, repeat character,
escape character, terminal character buffer pointer,
Subsystem newline character, kill response (the string that gets
printed when a kill character is encountered), terminal attributes,
and terminal character count.
In addition, it "opens" the user's terminal on the file descriptor

and sets the Subsystem printer form and printer destination.
Finally, it sets all entries in the standard port table to TTY.
