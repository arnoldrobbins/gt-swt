'Rmseg$' cleans out the segment directory open on the Primos file
unit given as its sole argument.
.im
'Rmseg$' deletes successive entries in the directory using the Primos
routine SRCH$$.
When 'rmseg$' comes across an entry that is itself a non-empty
segment directory, it opens that directory then calls itself
recursively to clean it out.
When all entries have been removed, the directory itself is
set to zero length.
