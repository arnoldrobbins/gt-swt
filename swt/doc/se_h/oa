        oa -- Option Absolute

               default range             syntax
                   1,$                     oa

        "oa" toggles the Absolute line numbers flag, which  determines
        whether  the numbers in the left margin shall be absolute line
        numbers, or the (usually capital) letters that refer to  lines
        by  the  position  at  which  they  are being displayed on the
        screen.  In any case, the current line is always shown as  "."
        (with  the "->" arrow to make it easy to find), the first line
        in the buffer is labeled "1", and  the  last,  "$"  (when  not
        ".").   Lines  can  be  referred  to  by  letter ONLY when the
        letters appear in the left margin.

        For general information about the option command, type "ho".
        See also "hln" for how lines can be referred to in commands.
