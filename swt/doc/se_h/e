          e    -- Enter command

               default range           syntax
                         n/a           e[!] [file name]

        "e" prevents one from having to exit and reenter the editor to
        edit  a  different file.  "e" empties the edit buffer, reads a
        file, and resets the remembered file name.  If [file name]  is
        omitted,  the  remembered  file  name is used.  [!] is used to
        override a check made to prevent you from accidently losing  a
        buffer that has not been saved (same as in "q").

        To return to the command directory, type "hcomdir."
        See also:  "hq"
