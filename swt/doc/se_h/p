          p    -- Print/Previous screen command

               default range           syntax
               see below               [range] p

        "p"  prints  a  range of lines or the previous screen (when no
        range is provided).  The line pointer is set to the last  line
        printed  (a  new  screen  may  be printed).  When the previous
        screen is printed, the first line on the  current  screen  be-
        comes  the  line  pointer, usually the last line on the screen
        (exception is when the first page is printed).
