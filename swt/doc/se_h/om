        om -- Option Message

               default range             syntax
                  1,$                     om

        "om" is a message option  that  allows  one  to  view  on-line
        messages   (automatically   notified  by  the  screen  editor)
        whenever a user wishes.  If a message is pending the user  may
        peruse  the  first  12  lines  of  a  message  by typing "om",
        followed by a carriage return.  If no  messages  are  pending,
        then  the  user  is so notified, thus it is possible to "poll"
        for on-line messages by typing "om", whenever desired.  During
        a session a user is  currently  only  notified  of  the  first
        arrival of a message.

        For general information about the option command, type "ho".
