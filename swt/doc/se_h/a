         a    -- Append command

              default range           syntax
                          .           a

        "a" is for appending new lines of text after a given line.  If
        no line number is typed before the "a", text will be  appended
        after  the  current  line.  The last line appended becomes the
        current line.  To signal the end of  the  appended  text,  you
        type a "."  on a line by itself.  Control characters "f", "v",
        "l",  and  "k"  work differently for "a" command than for "v".
        "a:"  works as a one line append (i.e. anything following  the
        colon is appended after the current line).

        To return to the command directory, type "hcomdir."
        See also:  "hcc" (control characters) and "hc" (change).
