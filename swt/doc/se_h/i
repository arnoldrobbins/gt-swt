         i    -- Insert command

              default range           syntax
                          .           i

        "i"  is  for  inserting new lines of text before a given line.
        If no line number is  typed  before  the  "i",  text  will  be
        inserted  before  the  current  line.   Lines  are continually
        inserted before the original line, which has the  same  effect
        as  append  does.  To signal the end of the inserted text, you
        only need to type  a  "."   on  a  line  by  itself.   Control
        characters  "f",  "v",  "l",  and "k" work differently for "i"
        command than for "v". "i:" works as a one line insert, similar
        to "a:".

        To return to the command directory, type "hcomdir."
        See also:  "hcc" (control characters) and  "hc"  (change)  and
        "ha".
