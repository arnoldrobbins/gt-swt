                                Command Syntax

        A command consists  of  an  optional  list  of  LINE  NUMBERS,
        followed  by a COMMAND LETTER, possibly followed by parameters
        allowed or required for a specific  command.   Preceeding  all
        this,  there  can be a GLOBAL PREFIX preceeded optionally by a
        list  of  line   numbers.   Hence   the   whole   syntax   is:

        [[<list>]<global prefix>][<list>]<command letter>[<stuff>]

        For general information about commands, type "hcom".
        For information about specific commands, type "hcomdir".
        For GLOBAL PREFIX syntax and semantics, type "hg".
        For LINE NUMBER LIST syntax and semantics, type "hlist".
