        og -- Option Global

               default range             syntax
                  1,$                     og

        The "g" option controls the behavior of the Substitute  command
        when it  is under the control of a Global  command.  Initially,
        if a substitute inside a global command fails, se will not con-
        tinue with  the rest of the lines  which might succeed. If "og"
        is given, then  the global substitute  will continue, and lines
        which failed will not be affected. Succesive "og" commands will
        toggle this behavior.  An explanatory message is placed in  the
        status line.

        For general information about the option command, type "ho".
