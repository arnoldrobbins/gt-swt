                               Arguments (cont)

        Once the terminal type  is  established,  the  remaining  arg-
        uments  are  interpreted  thus:  if the argument begins with a
        "-", the rest of it is interpreted as though it appeared after
        the "o" in an option command.  For  example,  an  argument  of
        "-w10"  acts  as  a command "ow10".  On the other hand, if the
        argument does not begin with "-", it is interpreted as a  file
        name  (path-  name).   The  named  file  is read into the edit
        buffer, and its name becomes the  remembered  file  name.   If
        more  than one file is named, the edit buffer will contain the
        contents of all the files.  If  an  error is encountered while
        interpreting arguments (file not found, illegal  option),  the
        remainder will be ignored.

        For invoking command syntax, type "hargs".
