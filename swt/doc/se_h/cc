        Control characters can be used for correcting typing mistakes,
        for correcting commands that have incurred an error message,
        or for editing the edit buffer ("inline editing") via the "v"
        command.  The novice should be told right away that hitting
        the DEL or RUBOUT key is a way to erase an erroneous command.
