                    Character Insertion Control Characters

        CTRL-C inserts a blank at the cursor position.
        CTRL-X inserts blanks to the next tab stop at the cursor position.
        CTRL-A toggles Insert Mode.

        When Insert Mode is in effect, any printing character typed is
        inserted into the line, with characters at and to the right of
        the cursor moving over to make room.  When Insert Mode is  not
        in effect, any printing character typed will replace (overlay)
        the character at the cursor.
