                    Command Terminating Control Characters

        The  Carriage Return character terminates a command, but first
        erases any characters at and  to  the  right  of  the  cursor.
        CTRL-V,  on  the other hand, skips the cursor to the right end
        of the line, then terminates it.  The "Funny Return" character
        CTRL-F serves different purposes depending on what routine  is
        soliciting the command.

        For more about CTRL-F, see "habt" and "hrpt".
        The general control character directory is "hcc".
