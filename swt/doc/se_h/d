        d    -- Delete command

               default range           syntax
                         .,.           d

        "d"  is  used  to  delete  lines of text from the buffer.  The
        lines in the range specified  by  the  line  number  list  are
        deleted.   The  positioning  of the current line pointer after
        execution of the "d" command is controlled by the "d"  option;
        see  "hod".   The  normal  behavior  is to make the first line
        AFTER the lines deleted the new current line.

        To return to the command directory, type "hcomdir."
        See also "hod".
