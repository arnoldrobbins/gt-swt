                     For line number syntax, type "hln".
                   For details about PATTERNs, type "hpat".

        A line number term consisting of  a  PATTERN  between  slashes
        causes  a  scan to begin with the line after the current line.
        If the last line is encountered, the scan continues with  line
        1.   The  current  line  is the last to be examined.  The line
        referred to is the first line encountered  in  the  scan  that
        contains  a  match  for  the  pattern.   If  the entire buffer
        contains no match, then an error is flagged.  If  the  pattern
        is  enclosed  in  question marks,  the  scan is in the reverse
        direction and begins with the line  just  before  the  current
        line,  and  wraps  around  to  the  last  line after line 1 is
        examined.  ">" and "<" mark name searches proceed in the  same
        wraparound fashion.
