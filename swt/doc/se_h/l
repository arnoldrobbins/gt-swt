        l -- Locate command

             default range         syntax
               none                  l

        "l"  will  put  the  contents  of the first line of the file
        =installation= into the status line.  This is  so  that  you
        can tell  what  machine you are using from within the screen
        editor.  This is particularly useful for installations  with
        many  machines  that  can run the editor, where you are able
        to  switch back and forth between them, and become  confused
        as to where you are at a given moment.

        To return to the command directory, type "hcomdir."
