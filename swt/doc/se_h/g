          g    -- Global command

               default range           syntax
                         1,$           g/pattern/command

        "g"  is  used  to perform an editing command on all lines that
        match the "pattern".   "pattern"  is  any  legal  pattern  and
        command is an editor command.  The "x" command is the converse
        of "g" and performs the command on all lines that do not match
        the pattern.  The "/" may be any character.


        To return to the command directory, type "hcomdir."
        See also:  "hx" and "hpat".
