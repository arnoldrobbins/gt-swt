          q   --  Quit command

               default range           syntax
                   n/a                    q

        "q" is used to quit the screen editor  and  return  to  system
        command  level.  If changes have been made to the buffer since
        the last write ("w"), you will be asked if you really want  to
        quit.   If so, just do another "q" command (RETURN is all that
        required).


        To return to the command directory, type "hcomdir."
        See also:  "hok".
