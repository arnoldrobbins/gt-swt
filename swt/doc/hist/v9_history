$Reference Manual
#Updated  all  of  the  build  files  in  =doc=/build  to  use the
#"=fmac=/ev?*" macros instead of the "=fmac=/env?*".  Changed  the
#files   in   =doc=/man   to   use   the  newer  macros.   Updated
#=doc=/help/(bnf general) to use the newer macros also.
#
#This change might have effect on  local  documentation  on  other
#systems.
#
#The reason for these changes are:
#1) the newer macros are more flexible;
#2)  makes  possible  versions  of  the  Reference  Manual for the
#diablo, spinwriter, or for typesetting.

$se
#Added multiple features to it:
#  1) trailing delimiters are not needed
#  2) reads commands in =home=/.serc for startup
#  3) can call the shell
#  4) can switch between UNIX and SWT patterns and commands
#  5) global substitutes can continue if one fails
#  6) auto indent
#  7) the join command defaults to a blank
#  8)  's' by itself means 's//&/p'
#The help file (se.d) has been updated.
#Totally reworked the files in =doc=/se_h, for a massive improvement

$vedtlb
#Added  to  the 'ed' editor the same features as I put in the 'se'
#editor, with the exception of the .serc  file  and  auto  indent.
#Updated the help file (ed.d).
#
#Any  programs which use the vedtlb must now also load the vshlib,
#since the editor can now call the shell.  Changed the help on the
#edit subroutine to reflect this.

$sh
#Changed  the  shell  to  have  "while  ...  endw" and "repeat ...
#until" loops.  This involved writing a couple of routines to scan
#forward in the current input file and squirrel away the  commands
#until we hit the loop terminator.  Then rewind the input file and
#call  the  shell after the loops have been turned into labels and
#goto's.  You can call exit to terminate a loop but you cannot use
#a goto to jump out of a loop.

#Fixed  it  to  handle trailing 's on a word.  Also now checks for

$pg, page
#Fixed  the page subroutine to act like the editors and allow mis-

$xcc and its files
#Rewrote  xcc  in ratfor so that customers could compile it.  Made
#it into a compile-only interlude.  Two shell files, xcc and  xccl
#do   compile  and  compile+load  respectively,  while  =ebin=/xcc

#Added  code for several new terminals, gotten from the University
#of Iowa.  Terminals added were several ADM terminals, another HP,
#Infoton, Terak micro computer, and maybe some others.  I did this
#a while back, so I don't remember  exactly.   I  also  added  the

#Rewrote  it to be smarter about 1) the number of arguments passed

$vswtml: gcd, invmod, prime, pwrmod, set_?* (sect 4)
#Integrated  the routines remaining in the old vswtml with the new
#routines Gene wrote in vswtmath.  There  is  now  only  one  math
#library;  vswtmath.   Updated  the  documentation  to reflect the
#library that they are in, and the location of  the  linkage  file
#for  the  set_?* routines.  I left them in section 4, even though
#the other routines are in section 2.  I  will  try  to  write  an
#addendum or some such for the math library user's guide that Gene
#wrote.
!Wednesday, 07/25/84 07:30:04
*jeff
$sh, hist.r
#Added  the module 'hist.r' to the shell source.  A single call to
#a history routine was added to 'get_cl' in 'ci.r'  to  accomodate
#the  insertion  of the history into the command line.  Recompiled

$fmt, xfmt, guides, help pages for them
#1) Moved old fmt (source, fmt.d, fmt_guide) to the attic.  2) Did
#the same for xfmt.  3) Took xfmt, removed the code for trap hand-
#ling,  saving  and  restoring  the output buffer, and marking and
#returning lines.  Left in the code for appending to  macros,  and
#the .if command.  Installed this version as plain old fmt.  Fixed
#the  help  page for it.  4) Took the fmt guide and updated it for
#.if, .am, and the new functions and special characters.  Wrote  a
#brand  new  section  on  the  =fmac=/ugm macro package, including
#=fmac=/(ugh ugnh).  Made mention of the report  macros,  and  the
#thesis  macros  in  =fmac=/gt_thesis.   5)  Installed  the thesis
#macros there.  They could use some work, but I don't have time at
#the moment.  6) The new fmt has been built and  installed.   Xfmt
#was deleted from =lbin=.

#remaining routines.
!Wednesday, 07/25/84 10:24:56

$=src=/std.sh/history.sh
#Changed  history  to use repeat loops, and to crank up the screen
#editor on the description file.  This is especially  useful  when

#previous description.

$=src=/std.r/help.r
#Fixed  1)  problem with common (an array wasn't being declared in
#one routine which included the common block, causing  a  "smaller
#redefinition  of  common" error from the loader, and causing page
#to occasionally screw up).  and 2) to check for EOF return status
#from page, so that it will exit immediately.

*arnold
$vcglib
#Fixed  the  alloc.s  and free.s files to be closer to the ones in
#the C Standard I/O Library.  I.e, the alloc now does  some  error
#checking, and they now both have code to set the debug info (i.e.
#the  name  of  the  routine  for the runtime stack dump).  I also
#added the shifts.s file from the C lib, since Ed Hunt had changed
#VCG to use these, instead of having it build a shift  instruction
#and EXECing it.

#Fixed cc.sh and ucc.sh, and created compile.sh.   Put  the  shell
#files in //src/std.sh.  Rewrote the doc for cc, ucc, and ccl, and

$change
#'Change' had its own definition of the constant MAXPAT, which was
#considerably   *smaller*   than   the   current   definition   in
#=incl=/swt_def.r.i.  This caused it to bomb  on  large  patterns,
#e.g.   the  'loc'  file for the C Standard I/O Library.  Deleting
#this definition, and using the standard one,  allowed  things  to
#work properly.

$ld.r, swt_com.r.i
#Changed  the  location of swt$cm (probably much to the chagrin of
#our customers).  This was to accomodate the inclusion of the  vth
#library  into the standard library and because the shell's common
#blocks were expanding to the point they threatened  to  run  into
#swt$cm.   Everything  was recompiled and reloaded, in addition to
#'ld' which now thinks swt$cm is at "4040 10000".

#Backed  these files up into the attic (there is a cstuff.u direc-

#Split   each  of  these  routines  into  two  parts  (vcg_otg1.r,
#vcg_otg2.r, and vcg_otgmem1.r, vcg_otgmem2.r).   'Rp'  would  run
#out of dynamic memory space because of the huge number of symbols
#they  use  and the fact that I included so many more symbols into

#Backed  up  the  C  run time library to the attic.  Installed new

#2) uses the new math routines, 3)  implements  almost  everything
#reasonable  in  section 3 of the UNIX User's Manual for System V,

#everything is initialized at compile time, not run time.  Has new

#See the new guide for details of what the library contains.

#Modified  the  -b  option ("do C runtime stuff") to automatically
#load the vswtmath library (the C math routines  call  them),  and
#the  vshlib  library (the environment stuff needs it), along with
#the regular c$main startoff and ciolib run  time  library.   This
#way  ccl, ucc, and compile don't need to know too much about what
#C programs need, just the -b option to ld.
!Sunday, 08/19/84 11:42:33
*arnold
$//doc/man/s1/ld.d
#Added  info  to the doc on the -b option to indicate that ld will

#(This is it!  The history entry you've been waiting for!)  I bac-
#ked  the  stuff in //doc/guide/cc up to the cstuff.u directory in
#the  attic.   The  guide  was  in  absolutely  disgusting  shape.
#Replaced  it  with  an almost totally reworked guide for the com-
#piler.  Formatted and installed it.
#
#The new guide documents the existence of the new 'compile' inter-
#lude, has a whole new chapter  on  the  compile  time  facilities
#available  (the  include files), discusses loading C programs for
#bare Primos, and contains a totally reworked chapter on  the  run
#time  library.  I also just cleaned up the guide itself, in terms
#of how it made use of the ugm macros, and how some of  the  stuff
#was  formatted.   It  is now somewhat easier to deal with.  Where
#appropriate, there are margin bars; but for the compile time  and
#run  time  chapters,  the  entire chapters have margin bars.  The
#guide is now somewhat longer, but it is  considerably  more  com-
#prehensive, and better organized.
