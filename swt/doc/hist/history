$cdmlc, cobc, csubc, ddlc, f77c, fc, fdmlc
#Fixed  to  pipe  the output of the interludes into 'x' instead of
#calling  them  as  arguments.   This  prevents  running  out   of
#arguments by having them accepted as input.

$fsubc, pc, plgc, plpc, pmac, splc

$shtrace_cmd
#Fixed  the  two  character mnemonic for onunit tracing to be "ou"
#instead  of  "on"  which  prevented  "shtrace  on"   from   being
#recognized.

$mktr$
#Fixed  a  bug  which added a space in a pathname of one character
#which then proliferated throughout the  subsystem  making  single
#character filenames unusable.

$gfdata
#Fixed  a  bug  where  'szfil$' was declared integer, thus causing

$lib_def.r.i, vtterm, vt$pos

$fmt
#Added "italicizing" to fmt.  This involes the .it command and the
#[it   ...]    inline   function.   Italicized  text  consists  of
#<character><BS><underscore>, as opposed to underlined text  which
#is  <underscore><BS><character>.   The main reason for doing this
#is to give access to both italics and underlined  text  with  the
#OCS  Xerox  9700  laser printer.  Text meant for the line printer
#will come out the same (as underlined) when run through 'os'  and
#spooled.   Italicized text will come out as underscores on a CRT.
#Oh well; can't always have one's cake and eat it too.
