ninth major revision.  To give you an idea of its development,
[cc]mc
here is a short history of successive versions.
.in +10
.ta 4
.sp
.HI 5 "Version 1:"
.HI 3 [bf .]
Features: Basic utility commands, no redirection of input
or output, low-level routines for performing file
operations, but no consistent input/output.
.HI 3 [bf .]
Language: Fortran
.sp
.HI 5 "Version 2:"
.HI 3 [bf .]
Features: Almost complete set of utility commands, redirection
of input and output, all [ul Software Tools] i/o routines,
[ul Software Tools] editor and Ratfor, improved reliability
during information passing from one program to another.
.HI 3 [bf .]
Language: Low level routines in Fortran,
high level routines and programs in Ratfor
.sp
.HI 5 "Version 3:"
.HI 3 [bf .]
Features: Same as version 2, but with Primos compatible
i/o for speed;
new shell added later greatly expanded program interaction
.HI 3 [bf .]
Language: Almost entirely Ratfor
.sp
.HI 5 "Version 4:"
.HI 3 [bf .]
Features: Same as version 3, plus: (1) ability to
.nh
handle
.hy
file names of up to 32 characters on new Primos file
partitions; (2) much faster disk i/o (on an unloaded
system, benchmarks show an improvement on the order of
a factor of 20); (3) internal reorganization to speed
up command searches;
(4) support for virtual mode programs and a shared command interpreter.
.HI 3 [bf .]
Language: All higher-level routines in Ratfor.  A few
special routines in assembly language to provide capabilities not
inherent in Fortran.
.sp
.HI 5 "Version 5:"
.HI 3 [bf .]
Features: A new command interpreter supporting arbitrary networks
of pipes, generalized command file handling, and dynamic command
line structures was added.
General reorganization of Subsystem directories on disk.
.HI 3 [bf .]
Language: Ratfor and Assembler (PMA).
.sp
.HI 5 "Version 6:"
.HI 3 [bf .]
Features:  Shared libraries, maximal security under unmodified
Primos, increased robustness.
.HI 3 [bf .]
Language:  Ratfor and Assembler (PMA)
.sp
.HI 5 "Version 7:"
.HI 3 [bf .]
Features:  Much faster disk I/O, extensions to pathnames to allow
specification of non-file-system devices, new Ratfor preprocessor
with significant extensions, some general cleanup of code and
redundant tools, many additional tools.
.HI 3 [bf .]
Language:  Ratfor, Assembler (PMA), and some PL/I.
.sp
.HI 5 "Version 8:"
.HI 3 [bf .]
Features:  Additional I/O speed, reduced working set, support
for PL/I[bl]G, Pascal, Fortran 77, DBG, improved error handling,
terminal type handling, virtual terminal handler.
.HI 3 [bf .]
Language:  Ratfor, Assembler (PMA), and some PL/I.

.HI 5 "Version 9:"
.HI 3 [bf .]
Features: Increased security for shared segments, improved shell,
extended text editors and formatter, access to new Primos file
system features, some support for Prime's C compiler,
a high precision mathematics library, and an improved stacc.
.HI 3 [bf .]
Language:  Ratfor, Assembler (PMA), and some PL/I.

.SH "Authors and Origins"
The principal authors of the Software Tools Subsystem are Allen Akin,
Perry Flinn, Dan Forsyth, and Jack Waugh,
of the Georgia Institute of Technology,
aided by a cast of thousands.
.pp
The ultimate antecedent for the design of the Subsystem is
the UNIX operating system, written by Dennis Ritchie and Ken
Thompson of Bell Labs for the DEC PDP-11 computers.
.pp
.sb
The tremendous debt owed to Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger,
.xb
the authors of
.ul
Software Tools,
cannot be overstated.
