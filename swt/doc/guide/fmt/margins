.MH "Margins and Indentation"
.#
.SH "Margins"
All formatting operations are performed within the framework
of a page whose size is defined by four margins: top, bottom,
left and right.  The top and bottom margins determine the
number of lines that are left blank at the top and bottom of
each page.  Likewise, the left and right margins determine
the first and last columns across the page into which text
may be placed.
.#
.SH "Top and Bottom Margins"
Both the top and the bottom margins consist of two sub-margins
that fix the location of the header and footer lines.  For the
sake of clarity, the first and second sub-margins of
the top margin will be referred to as
'margin 1' and 'margin 2', and the first and
second sub-margins of the bottom margin, 'margin 3' and 'margin 4'.
.pp
The value of margin 1 is the number of lines to skip at the
top of each page before the header line, plus one.  Thus,
margin 1 includes the header line and all the blank lines
preceding it from the top of the paper. By default, its value is three.
Margin 2 is the number of blank lines that are to appear between
the header line and the first text on the page.  Normally, it has
a value of two.  The two together form a standard top margin of
five lines, with the header line right in the middle.
It is easy enough to change these defaults if they prove
unsatisfactory;  just use the 'margin-1' and 'margin-2' commands
.be
 [bf .m1] [cu +]N
 [bf .m2] [cu +]N
.ee
to set either or both sub-margins to [cu +]N.
.pp
The bottom margin is completely analogous to the top margin,
with margin 3 being the number of blank lines between the
last text on a page and the footer line, and margin 4 being
the number of lines from the footer to the bottom of the paper
(including the footer).  They may be
set using the 'margin-3' and 'margin-4' commands
.be
 [bf .m3] [cu +]N
 [bf .m4] [cu +]N
.ee
which work just like their counterparts in the top margin;
none causes a break.
.#
.SH "Left and Right Margins"
The left and right margins define the first and last columns
into which text may be printed. They affect such things as
adjustment and centering.  The left margin is normally set
at column one, though this is easily changed with the
'left-margin' command
.be
 [bf .lm] [cu +]N
.ee
The right margin, which is normally positioned in column sixty,
can be set similarly with the 'right-margin' command
.be
 [bf .rm] [cu +]N
.ee
To ensure that the new margins apply only to subsequent text,
each command causes a break before changing the margin value.
.#
.SH "Indentation"
It is often desirable to change the effective
value of the left margin for indentation, without actually
changing the margin itself.  For instance,
all of the examples in this guide are indented from the
left margin in order to set them apart from the rest of the text.
Indentation is easily arranged  using the 'indent'
command,
.be
 [bf .in] [cu +]N
.ee
whose parameter specifies the number of columns to indent from
the left margin.  The initial indentation value, and the one
assumed if no parameter is given, is zero (i.e., start in the
left margin).
.pp
For the purpose of margin adjustment, the current indentation
value is added to the left margin value to obtain the effective
left margin.  In this respect, the [bf lm] and [bf in]
commands are quite similar. But, whereas the left margin value
affects the placement of centered lines produced by the [bf ce]
command, indentation is completely ignored when lines are centered.
.pp
Paragraph indentation poses a sticky problem in that the
indentation must be applied only to the first line of the
paragraph, and then normal margins must be resumed.
This can't be done conveniently with the 'indent' command,
since it causes a break.  Therefore, 'fmt' has a
'temporary-indent' command
.be
 [bf .ti] [cu +]N
.ee
whose function is to cause a break, alter the current
indentation value by [cu +]N until the next line of text is
produced, and then reset the indentation to its previous
value. So to begin a new paragraph with a five column indentation,
one would say
.be
 [bf .ti] +5
.ee
.#
.SH "Page Offset"
As if control over the left margin position and indentation
were not enough, there is yet a third means for controlling
the position of text on the page.  The concept of
a page offset involves nothing more than prepending a number
of blanks to each and every line of output. It is primarily
intended to allow output to be easily positioned on the
paper without having to adjust margins and indentation
(with all their attendant side effects) and without having
to physically move the paper.
Although the page offset is initially zero, other
arrangements may be made with the 'page-offset' command
.be
 [bf .po] [cu +]N
.ee
which causes a break.
.pp
'Eo' and 'oo' commands allow you to specify different page
offsets for even- and odd-numbered pages respectively.
Like 'po', they are initialized to zero and revert to
that value when no parameter is specified.  For instance,
.be
 [bf .eo] [cu +]N
.ee
will change the even-numbered page offset by N (or to N if
no sign is specified).
.#
.SH "Margin Characters"
It is common practice in the revision of technical literature
to indicate parts of the text that are different from previous
versions of the same document.  Such changes are usually indicated
by "revision bars" which are vertical lines in the left margin
of lines that are new or revised.  'Fmt' provides for this
capability with two formatting commands.  The 'margin-offset'
command,
.be
 [bf .mo] [cu +]N
.ee
without causing a break,
specifies that [cu +]N columns are to be reserved between the
'page-offset' columns and the 'left-margin' column for revision
bars or other marginal characters.  The margin offset starts out
at zero, and reverts to that value if no parameter is specified.
.pp
Once a non-zero margin offset has been set, any arbitrary character
may be placed in the leftmost column of the area with the
'margin-character' command:
.be
 [bf .mc] <char>
.ee
Initially, and when <char> is omitted, this character has
blank as its value.  For revision bars, <char> would be
specified as "|".  Whatever character is specified, it is
placed next to the left margin on every line of output as long
as the margin offset is non-zero.
