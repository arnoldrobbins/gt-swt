                 subroutine gky$xs (word)
                 shortcall gky$xs (2)

                 integer word

                 Library: shortlb
                 Also declared in =incl=/shortlb.r.i


            _F_u_n_c_t_i_o_n

                 This subroutine loads the current cpu keys into 'word'.


            _I_m_p_l_e_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n

                 Implemented  as  a  simple  PMA  routine  entered via a JSXB
                 (shortcall).  The subroutine uses the TKA instruction.

                 Note that any routine using this call must be compiled using
                 the "-q" option of 'fc'.
