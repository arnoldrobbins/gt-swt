            _F_u_n_c_t_i_o_n

                 This  routine  removes  a 16 bit quantity (into the variable
                 'item') from the top of a circular queue  (deque)  structure
                 at  'qu'.   The  function  result is TRUE if the removal was
                 done, FALSE if the queue was empty (before the call).

                 The  declaration   'queue_control_block'   is   defined   in
                 =incl=/shortlb.r.i;  this  file  should  be included if this
                 routine is used.


            _I_m_p_l_e_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n

                 Implemented as a simple  PMA  routine  entered  via  a  JSXB
                 (shortcall).  The function executes the RTQ machine instruc-
                 tion.

                 Note that any routine using this call must be compiled using
                 the "-q" option of 'fc'.

                 qu, item


            _B_u_g_s

                 The routine makes no attempt to validate the argument passed
                 as a queue control block.

                 Locally supported.
