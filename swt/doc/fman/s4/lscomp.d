                 The  linked  strings specified by 'ptr1' and 'ptr2' are com-
          |      pared on the basis of ASCII collating sequence.   The  value
          |      of  the  function is '>'c, '='c, or '<'c, depending upon the
                 relation that the first string has to the second.

                 Characters are extracted from  the  strings  using  'lsgetc'
                 until  two  unequal characters are found or an EOS character
                 is seen.  The returned value is then decided from these  two
                 characters:   if  one  of  the characters is EOS, the longer
                 string is considered greater; if both of the characters  are
                 EOS,  the strings are considered equal; if neither character
                 is EOS, the string with the larger character  is  considered
                 greater.
