                 integer function lslen (ptr)
                 pointer ptr

                 The  length  of the string specified by 'ptr' is returned as
                 the function value.  'Ptr' is not modified.

                 The number of characters in the string is counted by calling
                 'lsgetc' until it returns EOS.  The length  is  computed  as
                 the number of calls to 'lsgetc' minus 1.
