                 subroutine set_subtract (set1, set2, destination)
                 pointer set1, set2, destination

                 'Set_subtract'  performs the set subtraction operation, i.e.
                 places in the set 'destination'  those  elements  of  'set1'
                 that  are  not  in  'set2'.  For proper operation, all three
                 sets should be the same size.

                 All set manipulation routines make use of  dynamic  storage,
                 which  must  be  initialized  before  use.  See 'dsinit' for
                 further information.

                 Note that all set manipulation routines have long names.  To
                 avoid unique name conflicts with other routines, any  Ratfor
                 program  using the set routines should include the following
                 statement:

          |           include "=src=/lib/math/swtmlb_link.r.i"


            _I_m_p_l_e_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n

                 Since sets are represented as bit vectors,  the  subtraction
                 operation is performed by logically 'and'ing the elements of
                 the  first  set  with  the  negation  of the elements of the
                 second set.

                 Should work with sets of differing sizes.
