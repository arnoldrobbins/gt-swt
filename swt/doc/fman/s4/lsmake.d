                 pointer function lsmake (ptr, str)
                 pointer ptr
                 character str (ARB)

                 The  contiguous  string  in  'str' is copied into the linked
                 string space and a pointer to the string is returned both in
                 'ptr' and as the function value.


            _I_m_p_l_e_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n

                 A new string is allocated with the same length as 'str'  via
                 a  call  to  'lsallo'.   Characters are then copied into the
                 string using 'lsputc'.
