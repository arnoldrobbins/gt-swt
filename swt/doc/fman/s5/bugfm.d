                 'Bugfm' is not meant to be directly user-invoked; rather, it
                 is  a  utility  used by the 'bug' command to solicit for bug
                 report information such as the name  of  the  reporter,  the
                 name of the command or subroutine which is suspected of hav-
                 ing  a  bug,  the name of an example file which generates an
                 error with the named  program,  and  a  description  of  the
                 error.

                 The  time,  date,  and  login  name  of the bug reporter are
                 inserted  in  the  resulting  bug  report  to  allow  report
                 verification.   The resulting bug report is sent to standard
                 output.
