                 'Bugn'  is  not intended to be user-invoked; rather, it is a
                 utility used by the 'bug'  command  to  aid  in  bug  report
                 generation.  It determines what the highest bug number is so
                 far;   if  the  optional  argument  "-i"  is  specified,  it
                 increments the bug number and replaces the old  highest  bug
                 number  with  the  new  one.   In either case, it prints the
                 resulting bug number on standard output.

                 =bug=/$ to store the current highest bug number; use of  the
                      "-i" option causes this file to modified.
