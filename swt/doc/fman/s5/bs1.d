                 'Bs1' is a shell file that executes the program 'guess' when
                 a  command  is  not  found  in  a  user's search rule.  This
                 program is identical to 'bs' except that  it  calls  'guess'
                 with  an  argument of "1" for <maxcost>.  This significantly
                 reduces the search time, but restricts the set  of  commands
                 that 'guess' will consider.

            _B_u_g_s

                 Because  of  search rule problems, 'bs1' will fail if a user
                 does not have the current directory in his search rule.

                 Locally supported.
