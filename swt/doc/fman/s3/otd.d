          |      'Otd'  is  a program that reads relocatable binary files and
          |      prints their contents in human-readable form.  It is  useful
          |      for  analyzing  the output of high level language compilers.
          |      You can use 'otd' to compare the quality of  two  compilers'
          |      code generation phases, or for debugging your own compilers.
