                 'Rtime'  is a shell program that will determine the CPU time
                 used by the execution of a particular command.  The  command
                 to  be  timed should be specified as the set of arguments to
                 'rtime'; quoting of the command to prevent premature evalua-
                 tion of any command-language metacharacters is recommended.

                 The given command is used in a function call, and its output
                 on standard output one redirected to /dev/tty  if  no  other
                 i/o  redirection for standard output one is specified.  This
                 may cause problems if the command uses  all  three  standard
                 output ports.
