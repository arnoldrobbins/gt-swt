          |      The  'broadcast'  command allows users to send a Primos mes-
          |      sage on all systems that are running the SWT process 'ring'.
          |      If the first argument is "all", 'ring' broadcasts  the  mes-
          |      sage  to  all  users  on each machine in the ring, otherwise
          |      <user> is the user name of the  recipient  of  the  message.
          |      The  remaining  arguments  constitute  the  text  of  the 80
          |      character message to be broadcast.  If omitted,  'broadcast'
          |      reads  one  line  from standard input (STDIN) and broadcasts
          |      it.  If no arguments are given, 'broadcast' reads  one  line
          |      from STDIN and broadcasts it to all users.
