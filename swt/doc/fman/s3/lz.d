          |      'Lz'  post  processes  output  from 'fmt' for the Xerox 9700
          |      laser printer owned by the Georgia Tech Office of  Computing
          |      Services.   In  particular, it outputs the necessary control
          |      statements to get  actual  boldfacing  and  italics.   _T_h_e_s_e

          |      The  'fmt'  input  files  should  expect  a page that is 100
          |      columns  wide  by  87  lines  down.    The   laser   printer
          |      automatically supplies 1/2 inch margins on all sides, so the
          |      ...mmm111   through   ...mmm444   values   in   'fmt'  need  to  be  set
          |      appropriately, as well as the page and margin  offsets,  and
          |      the left and right margins.

          |      'Lz'  does  actual  underlining for text that is underlined.
          |      If the '-i' option is supplied, 'lz' will  print  underlined
          |      text in italics, instead.

          |      The  length  of  the  output page can be given with the '-l'
          |      option.  'Lz' defaults to 87 lines per page.
