                 'Mv'  moves  a file from one location or name to another, by
                 copying it and then deleting  the  original.   The  deletion
                 action  is not performed if the copy was not successful; the
                 copy is left untouched if the deletion  could  not  be  per-
                 formed.

                 'Mv'  can not move whole directories, use 'cp' with the "-s"
                 option.
