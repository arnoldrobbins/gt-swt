            _U_s_a_g_e

                 intel <object_file>  [ <relocation> ]


            _D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n

                 'Intel'  takes  the output of the Intel 8080 cross-assembler
                 ('as8080'), relocates it to  the  desired  starting  address
                 (0000  by  default),  and generates an Intel standard format
                 object tape on its first standard output.

                 'Intel' is useful for down-line loading  assembled  code  to
                 development systems equipped with a standard ROM loader.
