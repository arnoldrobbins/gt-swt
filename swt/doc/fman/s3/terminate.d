          |      The  'terminate'  command  is an interface to the SWT 'ring'
          |      process  which  allows  validated  users  to  terminate  the
          |      currently executing ring process on a system.  The specified
          |      'ring' process clears all of its connections and terminates.
          |      However,  since  a  'ring' process must always be running on
          |      each system in the ring to ensure the security of the  ring,
          |      the  shell file executing 'ring' will immediately re-execute
          |      it.  'Terminate' allows the  'ring'  comoutput  file  to  be
          |      reinitialized,  and  can be used to execute a new version of
          |      the  'ring'  process.   If  <system>  is  specified,  'ring'
          |      terminates  on  the machine with that system name, otherwise
          |      all 'ring' processes terminate.

          |      Cannot transmit TERMINATE request
          |           Something  interfered  with  the  transmission  of  the
          |           TERMINATE  command  to the 'ring' process.  This should
          |           never happen.

          |           The system which was to be terminated  is  not  in  the
          |           ring.

          |      Ring connection has been terminated
          |           The connection to the 'ring' process has been cleared.

          |           The  TERMINATE  command has been successfully attempted
          |           on all requested systems.
