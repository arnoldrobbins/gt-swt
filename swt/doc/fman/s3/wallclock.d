          |      'Wallclock'  is  a  program  which  uses the CRT as a rather
          |      large (and expensive) digital display timepiece.  It  prints
          |      out  the time that the "clock" was started, in small charac-
          |      ters, and then  every  <delay>  seconds  (default  is  one),
          |      updates the current time, in large characters.

          |      The  characters  will  be  made  up of "*"s, unless the user
          |      cares to specify an alternate character in <fill_char>.

          |      To stop the clock, use the BREAK key, or type a control-p.
