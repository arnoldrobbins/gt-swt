          |      'Lfo'  prints  the  following information on STDOUT for each
          |      process number and for all processes owned by each user name
          |      specified:

          |           1. the user name and process-id;
          |           2. his accumulated cpu and io times;
          |           3. his initial, current, and home directories;
          |           4. every open file unit and its associated pathname.

          |      If no arguments are specified, 'lfo' lists  the  information
          |      for as many processes as possible.  The normal user may list
          |      only  his  own  processes,  while a system administrator may
          |      list any process on the system.
