                 'Rtn$$'  unwinds  the  stack  and  returns  to  the  routine
                 (usually 'call$$') indicated by 'rtlabel' in  the  Subsystem
                 common block.

                 'Rtn$$'  first checks the Primos command level data flags to
                 see if the calling routine was DBG; if  so,  it  immediately
                 exits.   If it was not called by DBG, 'rtn$$' returns to the
                 routine  indicated  by  'rtlabel'  via  the  Primos  routine
                 PL1$NL.
