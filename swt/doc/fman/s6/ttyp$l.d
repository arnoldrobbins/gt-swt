                 'Ttyp$l'  will  list all of the terminal types that are sup-
                 ported by the Subsystem and its associated software packages
                 (such as VTH).

                 'Ttyp$l' opens the  "=ttypes="  (nominally  "//extra/terms")
                 file, if it can, and lists the terminal types available in a
                 readable format to the terminal.

          |      Some might consider it a bug that the output is always writ-
          |      ten to the terminal.
