          |      'Rmfil$'  is  used to remove files, segment directories, and
          |      access categories by name.  The sole argument is the name of
                 a file (of either type, in  the  current  directory)  to  be
                 deleted.   Note  that  the  name  is  _n_o_t  an EOS-terminated
                 string; it is a packed, blank-filled  array  of  characters.
                 The  function  return  is  OK  if the deletion occurred, ERR
                 otherwise.

                 'Rmfil$' uses the Primos routine SRCH$$ to delete  the  file
                 if  possible.   If  this attempt fails because the file is a
                 non-empty segment directory, it is opened and cleaned out by
          |      a call to 'rmseg$', then deleted by  SRCH$$.   If  it  fails
          |      because  the  file is an access category, it calls CAT$DL to
          |      remove it.
