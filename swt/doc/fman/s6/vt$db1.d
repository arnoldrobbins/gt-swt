                 'Vt$db1' is used to print out a label in 'title', along with
                 the   mnemonics  for  the  special  (unprintable)  character
                 sequence in 'seq'.

                 'seq',  up  to the first EOS, is converted to its associated
                 mnemonic and printed out.  All output is written to ERROUT.
