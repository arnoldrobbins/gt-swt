                 'Mkdir$'  is  used  to create a new directory.  The argument
                 'name' is the pathname of the directory to be  created;  the
                 arguments 'owner' and 'non_owner' specify the owner and non-
                 owner  passwords,  respectively,  of the new directory.  The
                 function return is OK  if  the  directory  was  successfully
                 created, ERR otherwise.

                 'Getto'  is  called  to  attach  to the directory which will
                 become the parent of the new directory.  A call to  'findf$'
                 insures that the directory does not already exist.  The pas-
                 sword  strings  are  converted to packed format via calls to
                 'ctop'.  The Primos  routine  CREA$$  actually  creates  the
                 directory  and  sets the passwords.  Then the Primos routine
                 SATR$$ is called to set the protection so that the owner has
                 all rights and non-owner has read access.
