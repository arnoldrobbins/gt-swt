                 'C$incr'  is  called  from  Ratfor  programs  that have been
                 processed with the "-c" (statement count) option.  Calls  to
                 'c$incr' are planted before each executable statement in the
                 program to keep track of the number of times the correspond-
                 ing statement was executed.

                 The  sole  argument is the line number (in the Ratfor source
                 code) of the line containing the statement  being  executed.
                 Each  call  to 'c$incr' with a given line number as argument
                 causes the count for that line to be incremented by one.

                 A common block ('c$stc'), created  by  Ratfor,  contains  an
                 array  of statement counts indexed by line number.  'C$incr'
                 simply increments the appropriate element of the array.
