                 integer function tputl$ (line, fd)

                 'Tputl$'  is  the device-dependent driver called by 'putlin'
                 to write a string on a terminal file.  The first argument is
                 the string to be written; the second is the file  descriptor
                 of  a terminal file.  The function return is OK if the write
                 was successful, ERR otherwise.

                 'Tputl$' buffers each character in the string into  a  local
                 buffer,  and  outputs the string in chunks (via calls to the
                 Primos routine  TNOUA).   If  case  mapping  is  in  effect,
                 characters not on a KSR 33 keyboard are converted to escaped
                 representations which are printable on a KSR 33.
