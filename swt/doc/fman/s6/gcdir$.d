                 'Gcdir$'  is  used  to  determine  the  full pathname of the
                 current working directory.  The sole argument is a character
                 array to receive the pathname.  The function return is OK if
                 the name could be found, ERR otherwise.

                 'Gcdir$' first obtains the treename of the current directory
                 using the Primos routine  GPATH$.   This  treename  is  then
                 unpacked  by 'ptoc' and passed to 'mkpa$', which converts it
                 into a SWT pathname.

                 Be  warned  that  because  of  Prime's  password  protection
                 scheme,  it is not always possible to obtain a pathname that
                 can later be used to attach to the home directory  with  the
                 same access rights.
