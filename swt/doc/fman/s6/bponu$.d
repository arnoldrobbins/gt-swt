                 'Bponu$'  is an on-unit handler for the "BAD_PASSWORD$" con-
                 dition.  It is used by 'getto' to catch  directory  attaches
                 which fail because of a bad password.

                 'Bponu$'  should  never be called by the user as such; it is
                 invoked   when   the   on-unit   mechanism    detects    the
                 "BAD_PASSWORD$" condition.

                 'Bponu$' calls the Primos PL1$NL routine with the "bad pass-
                 word label"  (i.e.,  address  of  the  password error return
                 location) to execute a "nonlocal goto" to that routine.
