                 'C$init'  is  called at the beginning of the main program in
                 Ratfor programs that  have  been  processed  with  the  "-c"
                 (statement  count)  option  of  'rp'.   It  initializes  the
                 statement count array for statement count processing.

                 'C$init' is inserted into the Fortran output as inline code,
                 rather than being referenced  from  the  standard  Subsystem
                 library.   As  such,  it  can  never be accessed by the user
                 unless the "-c" option is specified (even  then,  it  should
                 not  be  called by the user, since the statement counts will
                 be erroneously modified).
