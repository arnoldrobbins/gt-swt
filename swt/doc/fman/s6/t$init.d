          |      'T$init'  is  called at the beginning of the main program in
          |      Ratfor programs that  have  been  processed  with  the  "-p"
          |      (profiling)  option  of  'rp'.  It initializes the profiling
          |      common blocks with the number of routines in the program.

          |      'T$init' is inserted into the Fortran output as inline code,
          |      rather than being referenced  from  the  standard  Subsystem
          |      library.   As  such,  it  can  never be accessed by the user
          |      unless the "-p" option is specified (even  then,  it  should
          |      not  be  called  by  the user, since it has no effect on the
          |      profiling information).

          |      A simple assignment statement initializes a variable in  the
          |      common  blocks  produced  by  'rp' and used by the profiling
          |      subroutines.
