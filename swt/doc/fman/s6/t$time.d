                 'T$time'  is  called  by  't$entr' and 't$exit' to fetch the
                 amounts  of  real  time,  cpu  time,  and  disk   I/O   time
                 accumulated so far during this run.

                 The   Primos   routine   TIMDAT   is  called  to  fetch  the
                 information, which is converted uniformly to timer ticks.
