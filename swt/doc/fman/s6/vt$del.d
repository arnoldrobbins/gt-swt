                 subroutine vt$del (delay)
                 integer delay

                 'Vt$del'  is  used  to  delay  the terminal for 'delay' mil-
                 liseconds after certain operations.

                 The VTH common block is checked for the current baud rate of
                 the terminal.  'Delay' is then used to calculate the  number
                 of nulls to write to the terminal.
