                 'Dputl$'  is  called  by  'putlin' to write a line on a disk
                 file.  The first argument is an EOS-terminated string to  be
                 placed  on  the  disk  file; the second argument is the file
                 descriptor of the file on which the string is to be written.
                 The function return is OK for a successful call, ERR  other-
                 wise.   'Dputl$'  is  not  protected from user error, and so
                 should not be used except as it is called by 'putlin'.

                 'Dputl$' maintains a count of blanks to  be  used  for  file
                 compression.   When  a non-blank character is encountered in
                 the string, any  blanks  accumulated  are  translated  to  a
                 relative  horizontal  tab  (RHT)  and a blank count, and the
                 non-blank character is output.   Characters  placed  in  the
                 disk  buffer are output by a shortcalled routine internal to
                 'dputl$'; this routine calls the Primos routine PRWF$$ to do
                 the actual data transfer.
