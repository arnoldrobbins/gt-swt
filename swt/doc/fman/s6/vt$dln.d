                 'Vt$dln'  is  used  to  delete  a line at the current cursor
                 position on the user's screen.  The return value  is  OK  if
                 the line was deleted and ERR otherwise.

                 The subsystem common block is checked for the existence of a
                 delete  line sequence.  If one exists, it is written out and
                 'vt$del' is called to print out a small delay sequence.   If
                 the  sequence existed, the function returns OK and if it did
                 not exist, the function returns ERR.
