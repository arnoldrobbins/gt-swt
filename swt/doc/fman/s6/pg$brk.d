          |      'Pg$brk' is used by the 'page' subroutine to catch the QUIT$
          |      condition and return to a set place within it.

          |      The user should not call this routine directly.

          |      'Pg$brk' simply calls 'pl1$nl' with the 'Rtlabel' array from
          |      the Software Tools common block.  This was previously set to
          |      the proper label to return to.
