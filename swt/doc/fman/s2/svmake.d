          |      'Svmake'  creates  a  shell  variable  'name' at the current
          |      lexic level of the shell with the value 'value'.  The  func-
          |      tion  returns the lexic level at which the variable has been
          |      created.  If the variable controls a value kept in  the  SWT
          |      common  block,  the  value in the common block is updated to
          |      reflect the new value of the variable.

          |      First, 'svmake' checks the existence of the variable at  the
          |      current  lexic  level.   If  it  exists,  then  the function
          |      returns immediately; otherwise it  allocates  space  in  the
          |      variable  area  for  the  name  and  value.  If the variable
          |      controls a location in the SWT common block, 'svmake'  saves
          |      the current value in the SWT common and copies the new value
          |      in its place.
