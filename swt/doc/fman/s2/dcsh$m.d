          |      This   routine  calculates  the  hyperbolic  cosine  of  its
          |      argument, defined as cosh(x) = [exp(x)  +  exp(-x)]/2.   The
          |      absolute   value   of   the   argument  must  be  less  than
          |      22623.630826296.  The condition SWT_MATH_ERROR$ is signalled
          |      if  there  is  an  argument  error.   An  on-unit   can   be
          |      established  to  deal  with this error; the SWT Math Library
          |      contains a default handler named 'err$m' which the user  may
          |      utilize.   If  an  error  is signalled, the default function
          |      value is zero.
