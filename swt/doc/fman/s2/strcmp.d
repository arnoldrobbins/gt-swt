                 'Strcmp'  is  a  generalized string comparison routine.  The
                 two arguments are EOS-terminated strings to be compared; the
                 function return is 1 if 'str1' is less than 'str2'  (accord-
                 ing  to  the  ordering  of ASCII characters), 2 if 'str1' is
                 equal to 'str2', and 3 if 'str1' is greater than 'str2'.

                 If one string is a proper initial substring  of  the  other,
                 the longer string is always found to be greater.

                 Character-at-a-time   comparison   loop.    Function  return
                 depends on which string hit EOS first, or on ASCII  ordering
                 of character codes.
