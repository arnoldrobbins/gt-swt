          |      The  'dint$m'  function  implements the Fortran 'dint' func-
          |      tion.  That is, it takes  one  double  precision  value  and
          |      resets bits in the mantissa to remove any fractional part of
          |      the value.  The return value is a double precision real.

          |      The  'dint$m'  of  1.5 is 1.0, the 'dint$m' of -1.5 is -1.0,
          |      and the 'dint$m' of anything less than 1.0 and greater  than
          |      -1.0 is equal to zero.

          |      The 'dint$m' function has no single precision counterpart in
          |      the  SWT  Math  library.   The routine, as defined, does not
          |      recognize or signal any error conditions.  It is written  so
          |      as  to  work of both 550 and 750 style machines, despite the
          |      internal difference in register structure.

          |      The algorithm involved was  developed  from  known  register
          |      structure; see the source code for specifics.
