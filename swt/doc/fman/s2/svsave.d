          |      integer function svsave (file, trace)
          |      character file (ARB)

          | _F_u_n_c_t_i_o_n

          |      'Svsave'  takes  the  shell  variables  at lexic level 1 and
          |      writes them to 'file'.  Setting 'trace' produces a trace  of
          |      the  variables being saved on the users terminal.  The trace
          |      consists of the name of each variable being  saved  followed
          |      by  its  value.   The function returns ERR if the file could
          |      not be opened and OK otherwise.

          |      If the file can't be opened, then the  function  returns  an
          |      error;  otherwise,  the  current level of shell variables is
          |      traversed and written to the file.
