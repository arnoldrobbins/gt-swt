          |      This  routine  calculates  the  hyperbolic  tangent  of  its
          |      argument, defined as tanh(x) = 2/[exp(2x) + 1].   The  func-
          |      tion  never  signals  an error and returns valid results for
          |      all inputs.

          |      This function is intended to serve  as  a  single  precision
          |      function although it returns a double precision result.  The
          |      function  has been coded so that any value returned will not
          |      overflow or underflow  a  single  precision  floating  point
          |      value.   The  double  precision register overlaps the single
          |      precision register so it is possible to declare and use this
          |      function as simply a "real" function.
