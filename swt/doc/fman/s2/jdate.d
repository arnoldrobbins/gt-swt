                 'Jdate'  is  used to determine the Julian date corresponding
                 to a given month, day,  and  year.   (For  example,  January
                 first  of  any  year  has Julian date 1; December 31st might
                 have Julian date 365 or 366, depending on whether the  given
                 year  is  a  leap  year or not.)  The function return is the
                 Julian date calculated.

                 'Jdate' simply adds up the number  of  days  in  all  months
                 before  the month given, then adds the number of days given.
                 If the year specified is a leap year, February is  given  29
                 days instead of the usual 28.
