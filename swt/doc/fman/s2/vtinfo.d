                 integer key, info (ARB)

                 'Vtinfo'  is  used to return certain needed information from
                 the VTH common blocks.  The first argument is a key to  tell
                 'vtinfo'  what  set  of  information  to return.  The second
                 argument is an array to return the information.   The  func-
                 tion  return is OK if a correct key is given, and ERR other-
                 wise.

                 'Vtinfo'  currently  supports  the  following  value(s)  for
                 'key':

                 VT_MAXRC       returns  the  maximum  row and col values for
                                the user's terminal in the first two words of
                                'info'.

                 VT_WRAP        returns YES in 'info' if the  terminal  wraps
                                to the next line after putting a character in
                                the last column and NO otherwise.

                 VT_HWINS       returns  YES  in  'info'  if the terminal has
                                hardware insert capabilities.

                 VT_HWDEL       returns YES in 'info'  if  the  terminal  has
                                hardware delete capabilities.

                 VT_HWCEL       returns  YES  in  'info'  if the terminal has
                                hardware clear to end-of-line capabilities.

                 The key is checked as being legal, and  then  the  requested
                 information is simply copied from the VTH common blocks.
