                 'Remove' deletes the file specified by the pathname given as

                 out, ERR is returned; otherwise, OK is returned.

                 'Getto' is called  to  attach  to  the  UFD  containing  the
                 undesirable  file.   The  file  is  deleted  by  a  call  to
          |      'rmfil$', and a call to the Primos routine  AT$HOM  attaches
                 the  user  back  to  his  home  directory.   If  any call to
                 'rmfil$' or 'getto' fails, ERR is returned; otherwise, OK is
                 returned.
