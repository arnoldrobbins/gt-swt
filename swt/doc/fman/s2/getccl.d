                 'Getccl' converts the character class specification starting
                 at  'arg(i)'  into  a  pattern element starting at 'pat(j)'.
                 The pattern element consists of a character  count  followed
                 by  a  list  of  all  characters in the class.  The function
                 return is OK if the character class  was  successfully  con-
                 verted, ERR otherwise.

                 For   a   discussion   of   character  classes,  see  either

                 If  the  first  character  in  the  class specification is a
                 tilde, the class generated is a negated  class  rather  than
                 the standard class.  Room is then reserved for the character
                 count,  and  'filset'  is called to expand the specification
                 into the vector of characters.
