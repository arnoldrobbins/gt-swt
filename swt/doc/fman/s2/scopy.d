                 integer function scopy (from, i, to, j)

                 'Scopy'  copies  a  string  from  one place to another.  The
                 source string begins at the 'i'th character of  'from',  and
                 extends  to  an  EOS;  the  destination string begins at the
                 'j'th character of the string 'to'.  Copying takes place  by
                 character-by-character transfer until an EOS is encountered;
                 the  EOS  is transferred to the receiving string also.  When
                 it  finishes,  'scopy'  returns  the  number  of  characters
                 copied, excluding the trailing EOS.

                 A  simple  loop  copies  characters  from  one string to the
                 other, until an EOS is seen.
