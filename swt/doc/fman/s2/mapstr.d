                 integer function mapstr (str, case)

                 'Mapstr'  is  used  to  map the case of all the letters in a
                 string.  'Str' is the string to be mapped; 'case'  is  UPPER
                 if letters are to be mapped to upper case, anything else for
                 lower case (usually LOWER).

                 The  length  of  the  string  is  returned as the function's
                 value.

                 A loop is used to examine each character in the string;  the
                 actual   mapping  is  done  by  adding  or  subtracting  the
                 difference between ASCII 'a' and ASCII 'A'.
