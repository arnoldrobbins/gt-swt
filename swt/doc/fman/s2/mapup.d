                 'Mapup'  is the inverse of 'mapdn'.  If the character 'c' is
                 a lower case letter, the function return is the  correspond-
                 ing upper case letter; otherwise, the function return is the
                 same as 'c'.

                 In  'mapup',  as in 'mapdn', considerable use is made of the
                 internal ASCII character code.  If 'c' is between  'a'c  and
                 'z'c,  'c'  -  'a'c  +  'A'c  is returned; otherwise, 'c' is
                 returned.
