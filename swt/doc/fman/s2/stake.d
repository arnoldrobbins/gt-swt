                 integer function stake (from, to, length)
                 character from (ARB), to (ARB)
                 integer length

            _F_u_n_c_t_i_o_n

                 'Stake'   copies  the  number  of  characters  specified  by
                 'length' from the 'from' string into  the  'to'  string  and
                 returns  as  its result the number of characters copied.  If
                 'length' is positive, the characters  are  copied  from  the
                 beginning of 'from'; if it is negative, they are copied from
                 the end of 'from'.
