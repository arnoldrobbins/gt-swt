          | _F_u_n_c_t_i_o_n

          |      This  function calculates the inverse sine of an angle.  The
          |      argument to the function is the sine of the angle,  and  the
          |      function  returns  the  measure  of  the  angle, in radians.
          |      Arguments to the function must be  in  the  closed  interval
          |      [-1.0, 1.0].  If an error is signalled, the default function
          |      value  is  zero.  The condition SWT_MATH_ERROR$ is signalled
          |      if  there  is  an  argument  error.   An  on-unit   can   be
          |      established  to  deal  with this error; the SWT Math Library
          |      contains a default handler named 'err$m' which the user  may
          |      utilize.

          |      This  function  is  intended  to serve as a single precision
          |      function although it returns a double precision result.  The
          |      function has been coded so that any value returned will  not
          |      overflow  or  underflow  a  single  precision floating point
          |      value.  The double precision register  overlaps  the  single
          |      precision register so it is possible to declare and use this
          |      function as simply a "real" function.

          |      The function is implemented as a rational minimax approxima-
          |      tion  on  a modified argument value.  It is adapted from the
          |      algorithm  given  in  the  book  _S_o_f_t_w_a_r_e  _M_a_n_u_a_l  _f_o_r   _t_h_e
