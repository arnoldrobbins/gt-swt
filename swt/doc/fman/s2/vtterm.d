                 'Vtterm'  is  used  to  read  in  the  characteristics for a
                 terminal and put that information  into  the  common  blocks
                 used  by  the  other  VTH  routines.   It obtains the user's
                 terminal type and attempts  to  open  the  terminal  charac-
          |      teristic  file.   If it succeeds, the function return is OK,
          |      otherwise ERR.  The user should not call this  routine  him-
                 self,  but  should use the routine 'vtinit' as the interface
                 into this routine.

                 'Vtterm' calls 'gttype' to return the user's terminal  type.
                 It   attempts  to  open  the  file  "=vth=/<term_type>"  for
          |      reading, and if it can't, it  returns  ERR.   Otherwise,  it
          |      reads the file, decodes the symbolic characteristics, places
                 them in the VTH common block, and then returns OK.
