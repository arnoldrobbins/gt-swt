                 'Strlsr'  is  used  to  perform  a  linear search on a table
                 created by the Ratfor 'string_table' declaration.  The first
                 argument is the position array, the second is the  array  of
                 string  text  and  additional  information, the third is the
                 offset of the string text in the 'tab' array (i.e., the num-
                 ber of words of additional data associated with each entry),
                 and the last argument is a string containing the text to  be
                 sought.

                 The function return is the index of the element in the 'pos'
                 array  that  indexes  the  appropriate  entry  in  'tab'  if
                 'object' was found; EOF otherwise.

                 'Strlsr'  is  a straightforward linear search routine, using
                 'strcmp' to determine lexical equality of strings.
