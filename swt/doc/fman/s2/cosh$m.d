          |      This   routine  calculates  the  hyperbolic  cosine  of  its
          |      argument,  defined  as  cosh(x)  =  [exp(x)  +   exp(-x)]/2.
          |      Arguments  which  produce  a  value  too  large  for  single
          |      precision storage will signal the error condition.  The con-
          |      dition SWT_MATH_ERROR$ is signalled if there is an  argument
          |      error.   An  on-unit  can  be  established to deal with this
          |      error; the SWT Math Library contains a default handler named
          |      'err$m' which the user may utilize.  If an error is  signal-
          |      led, the default function value is zero.

          |      This  function  is  intended  to serve as a single precision
          |      function although it returns a double precision result.  The
          |      function has been coded so that any value returned will  not
          |      overflow  or  underflow  a  single  precision floating point
          |      value.  The double precision register  overlaps  the  single
          |      precision register so it is possible to declare and use this
          |      function as simply a "real" function.
