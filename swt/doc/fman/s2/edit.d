                 'Edit'  accesses  the  Subsystem  line-oriented text editor.
                 When called, 'edit' begins an editing session, reading edit-
                 ing commands from the file specified by "fdin"  and  writing
                 editing  output  on  the  file  specified  by  "fdout".   If
                 "filename" is other than an empty string, 'edit'  reads  the
          |      file into the edit buffer before accepting editing commands.

          |      Since  the  editor  can now call the shell, the shared shell
          |      library, 'vshlib', must be  loaded  along  with  the  editor
          |      library 'vedtlb' for any program that calls 'edit'.

          |      'Edit'  arranges  to  catch the 'LOGOUT$' condition.  When a
          |      LOGOUT$ occurs, 'edit' saves the  current  contents  of  the
          |      edit  buffer  in the file =home=/<prog>.logout, where <prog>
          |      is the name of the program using 'edit'.  For example,  'ed'
          |      would  have  the  buffer  saved  in  =home=/ed.logout, while
          |      'moot' would have its buffer saved in =home=/moot.logout.

                 For  complete   information   on   editing   commands,   see
