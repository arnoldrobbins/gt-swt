          |      The  'seed$m'  procedure  is used to reset the pseudo-random
          |      number generator to a known state.  It is called with any  4
          |      byte  value which is not equal to 32 bits of zero.  The seed
          |      can therefore be  4  characters,  a  long  pointer,  a  long
          |      integer,  or  a  real  number.  If the input is identical to
          |      zero then the SWT_MATH_ERROR$ condition is  signalled.   The
          |      condition  SWT_MATH_ERROR$  is  signalled  if  there  is  an
          |      argument error.  An on-unit can be established to deal  with
          |      this  error; the SWT Math Library contains a default handler
          |      named 'err$m' which the user may utilize.  'Seed$m' does not
          |      return a value.
