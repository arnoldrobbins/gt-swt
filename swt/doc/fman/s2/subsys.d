          |      'Subsys'   takes  an  EOS  terminated  string  as  its  only
          |      argument.  It then passes this string on to the shell to  be
          |      executed.

          |      'Subsys'  returns  ERR if it could not put the command where
          |      the shell can get to it.  Otherwise, it passes on the return
          |      code from the shell's execution of the command.

          |      'Subsys' first create a temporary file  with  'mktemp'.   It
          |      writes  the  command to be executed to the file, rewinds the
          |      open file descriptor, and then calls the 'shell'  subroutine
          |      on that descriptor.  Finally, it calls 'rmtemp' to close the
          |      temporary file.
