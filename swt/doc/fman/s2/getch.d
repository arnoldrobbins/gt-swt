                 'Getch'  is  used to get a character from a file.  The first
                 argument is assigned the value of the character fetched; the
                 second argument is the file descriptor of  the  file  to  be
                 read.   If end-of-file occurs on the input file, the charac-
                 ter  returned  is  EOF.   The  function  return  is   always
                 identical to the first argument (character read or EOF).

                 'Getch'  calls  'getlin'  with  a  very short line buffer (1
                 character + EOS).  'Getlin' thus returns  one  character  in
                 the buffer, which becomes the value returned by 'getch'.  If
                 'getlin' returns EOF, 'getch' also returns EOF.
