                 'Type'  returns the type of the character given as its first
                 argument:  LETTER if the character was a  letter,  DIGIT  if
                 the  character  was  a digit, and the character itself if it
                 was anything else.

                 'Type' checks the  type  of  character  by  using  a  Ratfor
                 'select'  statement  listing  all  the letters in one alter-
                 native and all the digits  in  another.   If  the  character
                 falls  within  the  first  range,  LETTER is returned; if it
                 falls within the last range, DIGIT is  returned;  if  it  is
                 outside  of  both,  the  function  return  is  the character
                 itself.
