                 'Putlit' provides a way to place a literal string on a file.
                 Its  first argument is a packed character string, terminated
                 by a character specified in the second argument.  The  third
                 argument is the file descriptor of the file to be used.

                 'Putlit'  is  maintained for compatibility with earlier ver-
                 sions of the Subsystem.  In the future, 'Putlin'  should  be
                 used to write literal strings.

                 'Putlit'  calls  'ptoc'  to  unpack its first argument, then
                 calls 'putlin' to print the unpacked string on the specified
                 file.
