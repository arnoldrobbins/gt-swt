                 'Subscribe' allows a user to become a subscriber to the Sub-
                 system news service.

                 There  is  no difference in the news received by subscribers
                 and non-subscribers; the only difference is that subscribers
                 are  automatically  informed  whenever  a   news   item   is
                 published.
