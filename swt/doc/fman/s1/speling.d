                 'Speling'  places on its first standard output a list of all
                 the words in the named files (or standard input, if no files
                 are named) that are not in the dictionary "=dictionary=".  A
                 "word" is a contiguous string of letters.   'Speling'  is  a
                 shell  program;  the user is referred to its text to see how
                 it works.  To see how the word file is constructed, see  the
                 files in the directory "=aux=/spelling".
