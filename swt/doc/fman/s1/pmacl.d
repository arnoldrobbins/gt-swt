                 'Pmacl' is a shell file that invokes the Primos Macro Assem-
          |      bler and the Primos segmented loader.  If 'pmacl' is invoked
          |      with  no <program name> argument, it automatically processes
          |      the last program edited, since it shares the shell  variable
          |      'f'  with  the  shell  program  'e'.   The  name of the file
                 containing the program to be compiled must  end  with  ".s",
                 although  in  <program  name>  it  may  be specified with or
                 without the ending ".s".  If no output file is specified  in
                 the  <'ld'  options>,  the  output  object file name will be
                 <program name> with no extension.

                 Concerning the options,  'pmac'  will  be  called  with  the
                 <'pmac'  options>  specified  on the command line; then 'ld'
                 will be called with the <'ld' options> specified.
