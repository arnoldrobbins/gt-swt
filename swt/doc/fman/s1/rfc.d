          |      'Rfc'  is  a  shell program that causes the specified Ratfor
          |      program to be preprocessed and compiled, but not loaded.  It
          |      is useful for rebuilding single modules  in  a  multi-module
          |      program.    The   source   file  is  expected  to  be  named
          |      <program>.r and the output object code is named <program>.b.
          |      A check is made  to  verify  the  existence  of  the  source
          |      program; if it is not present, processing is discontinued.

          |      The  ".r"  suffix  on  the source file name is not required,
          |      although 'rfc' requires that the source  code  reside  in  a
          |      file named with a ".r" suffix; thus one may write "rfc file"
          |      to compile the contents of "file.r".

          |      Special  options for 'rp' may be placed after the file name.
          |      Options for 'fc' may be placed after the  'rp'  options,  as
          |      long  as  the two groups are separated by a slash.  Example:
          |      "rfc prog -a / -c".
