                 'Rduniq'  is  part  of  the toy relational data base system,
                 'rdb'.  It removes duplicates from a sorted relation.  Stan-
                 dard input 1 must be directed to a file containing an  'rdb'
                 relation;  the  new  relation is written on standard output.
                 The input relation must be a file containing a relation that
                 was created by 'rdmake' or other 'rdb' program;  a  relation
                 cannot  be  read  from the terminal.  The output relation is
                 displayed in a readable format if standard output is  direc-
                 ted to a terminal (display in binary would be quite a mess);
                 otherwise,  the output relation is written in binary, inter-
                 nal format for processing by other 'rdb' programs.

                 If standard output is directed to "/dev/lps",  the  relation
                 is written in binary.
