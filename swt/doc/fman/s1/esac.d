                 'Esac'  is  a  do-nothing  command used to mark the end of a
                 case statement.  It may  be  searched  for  by  the  'case',
                 'when',  or  'out'  commands.   Every 'case' command must be
                 followed by a matching 'esac' command.

                 'Esac' may be used to regain control  of  a  terminal  after
                 execution of a 'when' or 'out' command.

                 Redirectors before 'esac' prevent its recognition by 'when',
                      'out', and 'case'.
