                 'Day'  prints the name of the day of the week (e.g.  Monday,
                 Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.)  on standard output one.  The name
                 is  printed  in  lower  case  with   the   first   character
                 capitalized.

                 Should no arguments be given, the name of the current day is
                 printed.   Optionally,  a  day  in  the  current month, in a
                 different month but the current  year,  or  in  a  different
                 month  and  year  may  be  given as an argument, and the day
                 associated with that date will be printed.
