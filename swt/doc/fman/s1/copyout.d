                 'Copyout'  opens  a  file in the spool queue and diverts the
                 user's command output into the file.  This diversion can  be
                 stopped by logging out or issuing a 'como' command.

                 'Copyout'  is intended for use by 'batch' to produce a batch
                 job listing, but it  may  accidentally  find  use  in  other
                 situations.

                 Diverting  a  screen  editor  session to the line printer is
                 very messy.
