                 'Dump'  is  intended  to  print  a semi-readable dump of the
                 various  Subsystem  data  areas.   It  dumps  any  of   four
                 different data areas, based on its arguments.  Following are
                 descriptions of the four different dumps.

                 "Ls"  or  "linked_string"  prints  the command interpreter's
                 linked string storage space  in  a  readable  format.   This
                 option produces a symbolic listing consisting of a series of
                 entries of the form

                      address -> item

                 where  "address"  represents an index into the linked string
                 storage space, and "item" is either  (1)  a  quoted  string,
                 representing  the  characters in memory at the given address
                 (e.g.  "peruse"); (2) the word LSNULL followed by a size  in
                 parentheses,  indicating available space in the storage area
                 (e.g.  LSNULL (1600)); or (3) the pointer "->"  followed  by
                 an  address, representing a pointer or link to another place
                 in the storage area.

                 "Sv" or "shell_variable" dumps  the  contents  of  the  hash
                 table  that  stores shell variables and their contents.  For
                 each active lexic level (currently active command file),  it
                 produces  a  symbolic dump of the five hashed lists used for
                 variable storage.  Each item in  each  list  consists  of  a
                 variable  name  followed  by  an  equals  sign  (=)  and the
                 variable's value.  Both  name  and  value  are  followed  by
                 indexes into the linked string storage area.

                 "Fd"  or  "file_desc"  dumps  the  Subsystem file descriptor
                 <num>.  If <num> is missing, all open file  descriptors  are
                 dumped.

                 "Cm"  or  "swt_common"  dumps the remaining Subsystem common
                 areas.
