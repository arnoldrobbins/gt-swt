                 'Rot' circularly rotates character strings found on standard
                 input  the number of positions specified by <rotation>, in a
                 manner  similar  to  the  APL  function   "reversal/rotate".
                 Specification  of  a  positive  <rotation>  will  rotate the
                 string  from  left  to  right  the  number   of   characters
                 specified.   If  <rotation>  is negative, the string will be
                 rotated from right-to-left.  When a  string  is  encountered
                 that is not as long as the absolute value of <rotation>, the
                 string  is  rotated  circularly  until the rotation count is
                 exhausted.

                 If <rotation> is not  specified,  the  strings  on  standard
                 input are reversed, as with the APL monadic function.
