          |      Several of the more complicated or more frequently used Sub-
          |      system  commands and libraries have additional documentation
          |      beyond that which is available from  the  reference  manual.
          |      This  documentation  is  in  the form of a separate paper on
          |      each command or library, but these papers may be combined to
          |      form the _S_o_f_t_w_a_r_e _T_o_o_l_s _S_u_b_s_y_s_t_e_m _U_s_e_r_'_s _G_u_i_d_e.

                 The command

                      guide <guide name>

                 prints the named guide in a format suitable for reading on a
                 fast CRT terminal.

                 The command

                      guide -p <guide name>

                 prints the named guide in a format  suitable  for  the  line
                 printer.

                 Copies  of individual documents may be printed on one of the
                 on-site line printers by giving the following command:

                      guide -p <guide name> | os >/dev/lps/f

                 where "<guide name>" is one of the following guide names:

          |           _U_s_e_r_'_s  _G_u_i_d_e  is  printed.   This  includes  tutorial,
          |           reference,  and  applications  information.   One  very
          |           useful appendix contains all text formatting  commands,
          |           arranged alphabetically.

          |           printed.  This paper gives a brief introduction to  the
          |           Primos file system as it applies to the use of the Sub-
          |           system.   It explains the structure of the file system,
          |           provisions for security, and how users access files  by
          |           name.

          |           A copy of the _S_W_T _M_a_t_h _L_i_b_r_a_r_y _U_s_e_r_'_s _G_u_i_d_e is printed.
          |           This  includes descriptions of the Prime floating point
          |           hardware, the SWT math library, and the tests  used  to
          |           validate  the  SWT  library.  Appendices contain useful
          |           programs  to  help  determine  where  the  exponent  is
          |           located  on  your  particular  machine,  determine  the
          |           amount of loss of bits in  a  multiply  operation,  and
          |           calculate hexadecimal constants for use in mathematical
          |           routines.   The  addendum  documents the routines which
          |           used to be in the old, locally supported, math  library
          |           "vswtml."

          |           is printed.  This guide is  useful  for  all  Subsystem
          |           managers  and  anyone  else  interested  in the instal-
          |           lation, maintenance, and daily operation  of  the  Sub-

          |           _U_t_i_l_i_t_y is printed.  This paper documents the structure
          |           and use of 'ring', a utility which makes it easier  for
          |           the end user to deal with Primenet.

          |           includes a detailed description of the Ratfor  program-
          |           ming language as well as instructions for its use under
          |           the Subsystem.  It is essential for anyone hoping to do
