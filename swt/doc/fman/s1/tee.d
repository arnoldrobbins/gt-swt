                 'Tee' creates multiple copies of data flowing into its first
                 standard  input.   By default, it copies this stream of data
                 to its first standard output.  In addition, a copy  is  made
                 on each of the files named in its argument list.  If a named
                 file did not previously exist, it is created.

                 If  an  argument  consists  only of a dash ("-"), optionally
                 followed by a single digit in the range 1-3, a copy is  sent
                 to  the standard output port corresponding to the digit.  If
                 the digit is missing, standard output one is assumed.

                 'Tee' is suitable for  checkpointing  data  flowing  past  a
                 given  point in a pipeline, or for fanning out a data stream
                 to feed multiple, parallel pipelines.
