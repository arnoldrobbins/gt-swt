                 'Cto'  copies its first standard input to its first standard
                 output, terminating either at  end  of  file  or  the  first
                 occurrence of <string>.  In order to be recognized, <string>
                 must  appear  on a line by itself.  This termination line is
                 not copied.  If no argument is specified, <string>  defaults
                 to "-EOF".

                 'Cto' is useful in shell files for terminating programs that
                 read  from  the command stream.  It is virtually a necessity
                 for generating end-of-file on terminals that cannot generate
                 a control-c character.
