                 'Fi'  marks the end of a conditional statement.  It is a do-
                 nothing command that may be searched for by either  'if'  or
                 'else'  in the process of skipping commands.  Each 'if' com-
                 mand must be followed by a matching 'fi' command.

                 If a terminal is locked up  due  to  an  unmatched  'if'  or
                 'else', the 'fi' command may be used to regain control.
