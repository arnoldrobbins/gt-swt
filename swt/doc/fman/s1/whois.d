                 'Whois' is used to determine the name of the user associated
                 with  a  particular  login name.  The most frequent usage is
                 "whois  <login_name>",  which  looks  up  the   login   name
                 specified  and  prints  the  name  of its owner.  If the "-"
                 option is specified, 'whois' prints the  entire  name  list.
                 If  no  argument  is  given, 'whois' accepts a list of login
                 names from standard input and prints the name of  the  owner
                 of each.
