          |      'Rdcount' is part of the toy relational data base management
          |      system,  'rdb'.   It  lists the number of rows in a relation
          |      satisfying the optional select  expression.   If  no  select
          |      expression  is  given then it lists the total number of rows
          |      in the relation.  Standard input 1 must  be  directed  to  a
          |      file containing an 'rdb' relation.  The result is written to
          |      standard output.

          |      The input relation must be a file containing a relation that
          |      was  created  by 'rdmake' or other 'rdb' programs; the rela-
          |      tion cannot be read from the terminal.  The  select  expres-
          |      sion  is  formed  from  the logical operators "&" (and), "|"
          |      (or), and "~" (not) connecting relational conditions involv-
          |      ing two domains or a domain and a literal.
