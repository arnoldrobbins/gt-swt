                 'Mkdir'  is  used  to  create a new directory.  The pathname
                 given as the first argument is the pathname  of  the  direc-
                 tory; all nodes but the last must exist prior to the invoca-
                 tion of 'mkdir'.  The "-o" and "-n" keyword arguments may be
                 used  to  specify  the  owner  and non-owner passwords to be
                 given to the new directory.  If they  are  omitted,  default
                 values are assumed as follows:  at installations running the
                 Georgia  Tech  version  of  Primos, the user's login name is
                 used for the owner password and the  non-owner  password  is
                 set to zero; at installations running unmodified Primos, the
                 owner  password  is set to blanks and the non-owner password
                 is set to zero.
