          |      'Xcc'  compiles  the  C program in <pathname> with Prime's C
          |      compiler.  The ".c"  suffix  on  the  source  file  name  is
          |      optional,  although  'xcc'  requires  that  the  source code
          |      reside in a file named with a ".c" suffix.   If  the  source
          |      file  name  specified  in  <pathname>  does  not have a ".c"
          |      suffix, 'xcc' will append a ".c" and attempt  to  process  a
          |      file   with  that  name.   The  object  code  is  stored  in
          |      "<pathname>.b".  If the "-b" command-line argument specifies
          |      <b_pathname>, 'xcc' stores the object code in  a  file  with
          |      that name.

          |      A  full description of the C language is beyond the scope of
          |      this document.  For complete information,  refer  to  _T_h_e  _C
          |      _P_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_i_n_g  _L_a_n_g_u_a_g_e  by  Brian W.  Kernighan and Dennis M.
          |      Ritchie (Prentice-Hall, 1978).

          |      The following options are available:

          |           -b   Compile the source code into the object file named
          |                "<b_pathname>".  'Xcc' places the object code into
          |                the  file  "<pathname>.b"  if   this   option   or
          |                <b_pathname> is unspecified.

          |           -c   Invoke the "-CHECKOUT" option.  This option causes
          |                the  compiler  to  parse  the  source code without
          |                producing object code.  This option suppresses the
          |                "-b" and "-l" options.

          |           -l   Produce a listing in  the  file  "<l_pathname>.l".
          |                If  <l_pathname>  is unspecified, 'xcc' places the
          |                listing in the file named "<pathname>.l".

          |      There is no way to tell Prime C programs about the  Subsytem
          |      standard input/output ports.
