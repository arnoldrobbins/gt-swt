                 'Clock'  generates  the  display for a digital clock, in the
                 form "hh:mm:ss".  It can be used on any  CRT  terminal  that
                 supports   the   "backspace"   function.    Time-of-day   is
                 guaranteed to be as accurate as the  wristwatch  of  whoever
                 last set the system time.

                 'Clock' is terminated by typing control-P or by pressing the
                 BREAK key.
