                 'Files'  is  a  shell file that invokes the 'lf' command and
                 filters its output through 'find' to select the  names  that
                 match the specified pattern.  The pattern may be any expres-
                 sion  that  is  acceptable  (as  a  pattern)  to 'find'.  By
                 default, the files in the current working directory are  the
                 ones  whose names are examined; however, an alternate direc-
                 tory may be specified as a second argument.  If no arguments
                 are specified, files produces the same results as an "lf -c"
                 command.
