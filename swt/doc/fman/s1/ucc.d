          |      'Ucc' is a "UNIX-style" C compiler and loader.  It does NOT,
          |      however,  behave  like  Unix's  'cc' or any other known Unix
          |      program!

          |      'Ucc'  compiles  and  loads  the  pathnames  specified.   It
          |      assumes  that  all  programs  require  C runtime support and
          |      loads them accordingly.

          |      'Ucc' recognizes the same set of options as 'cc'.  These are
          |      passed  as  C-specific  options  to  'compile'.   Any  other
          |      options  are passed on to 'compile' directly, which does the
          |      real work of recognizing suffixes and compiling and  loading
          |      the files appropriately.

          |      'Ucc' remains in existence mainly for compatibility with the
          |      first release of the C compiler.
