                 This section is devoted to the description of low level sup-
            port  Subsystem  commands.   These commands should not be invoked
            from command level, as they are intended to be  used  as  support
            for higher level commands.  Georgia Tech's low level support com-
          | mands  reside  in  the directory "=ebin=" and are supplied on the
          | Software Tools release tape.  The commands described in section 1
          | should be used to invoke the commands described here.

                 Documentation for each command is organized under  the  fol-
            lowing  headings.   Note  that  a  heading  will be omitted if it
            contains no additional information.
